"My mom then hit me with the newspaper and it shocked me that she would do this, she knows I don't like play hitting, smacking, striking, hitting or violence of any sort on my person.

While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like ""you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention"" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.",1
"until i met my new boyfriend, he is amazing, he is kind, he is sweet, he is a good student, he likes the same things as me, my family likes him, and so on... but i dont feel that passion that rush i felt with my ex, the truth is that when i started going out with my boyfriend i secretly saw my ex a few times to see if i really didnt feel nothing for him, but it was disgusting, i didnt even want him to touch me, i feel bad with myself i didnt want him, but still, i was there. then i kinda realized i felt nothing love related for him and it was ok, HE was HURT when he knew i was dating this boy and he even begged me to stay but of course not. but now the problem is that when im with my boyfriend i dont feel like i love him, like that thing you kinda have to feel with a new love, i just feel ""ok"" with him, and i catch myself thinking about my ex from time to time, remembering all the good things we had and it drives me crazy because i know that if i see him again i wont feel that way, that ""love"" that my mind makes me think stills there. and recently i found out that he has a girl and he is actually enjoying the experience and i got so mad and so hurt (i know i dont have any right to feel that way) i felt betrayed and I STILL feel that way, i gross myself out.",1
"October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and I am a domestic violence survivor who is still struggling, even after over four years. Lately I have been feeling very angry. Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions. This man abused me in all manners: physically, sexually, emotionally, verbally, financially, etc. I was granted a restraining order against him (and it was renewed a year later) but I was unable to press criminal charges against him because I didnâ€™t have enough evidence to have a case.",1

  It cleared up and I was okay but. On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did. That night was bad just like last time.   Also yesterday my sleep was bad I woke up like every hour of the night just like last time. I got kind of scared like I did last time but this time I think that this is fake life which is absurd but I just think about it then get really scared then I think rationally then calm down.,1
"I actually give an assistant half my emergency fee to come help me sometimes. I feel unsafe driving to ""house calls"" in the middle of the night by myself. I frequently bring my husband along as a makeshift â€œtechâ€ or when I feel unsafe, which is obviously unfair to him. Unhappy Husband: My husband is miserable both with his 60 minute commute and with our isolation out here in the country. We feel like we have no social life out here.",1
"I just feel like the street life has fucked my head up. There's so much I don't even know how to talk about anymore, I just hold that shit. Only person I can really chat with is a pal I know at the bar. He has PTSD and shit from the military bad, hard up alcoholic nowadays after killing people.. We talk once every few weeks and we are open and it's cool. But normal people?",1
"Next week Iâ€™ll be flying for our family vacation. The flights wonâ€™t be very long (just MSY to LAS then LAX to MSY on the way home), but flying really triggers my anxiety. Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings, so the idea of being in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air is not ideal for me. I also have a lot of fears about terrorist attacks/mass shootings (movie theaters and other crowded public places are also a problem for me). I was wondering if anyone has any tips for flying anxiety/fear.",1
"Everything sets me off and I'm almost having a panic attack. I'm going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I'm afraid that I'm not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really isn't happy when I do that. Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I've never raised my voice at her even when frustrated. When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily. I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.",1
"Iâ€™ve been taking 12.5 mgs zoloft for about 6 months (yeah, super small dose .. but it was taking the edge off, i think). I decided to stop taking it for a few days to see if it was really helping. Now, about 40 hours since my last dose, Iâ€™m suddenly kind of shaky and also flushed (my cheeks are burning for no reason. And THOSE side effects are about to freak me out - do you think it is from my missed dose? Is it possible to have such a fast reaction?",1
"No place in my city has shelter space for us, and I won't put my baby on the literal street. (I've been there before. Fine for new, but I don't want to have to go through that with a baby). What cities have good shelter programs for homeless mothers and children? I'd love to be able to make some calls and get on a greyhound between the 7th and 16th (when I'll likely be able to get the money to go).",1
These past couple of months have been the worst. My anxiety has gotten so bad itâ€™s effecting my sleep and relationship. Iâ€™ve become so paranoid about my health as well. I donâ€™t feel like me anymore and I just feel scared all the time now over every little thing. I donâ€™t have money to see a therapist either...,1
"I asked him three time what happened. And after the third time I cried and went home. Month later he still don't talk to me and he and my mother started fighting for the first time in the relationship. Me and my mother honestly don't know what to do, he just ignores me. I even told him that I don't date that guy(even though I date him) and he didn't even react to it.",1
"The sensation lasted hours. It seemed like a circulation problem, and I panicked and of course ended up in the ER again. This time a doctor came to see me immediately. He wanted to talk about my anxiety. He said he could run some more tests, but he didn't think it would help.",1
It did hurt but didnâ€™t leave any marks. When I lied down I kept coughing and today it feels kinda constricted like thereâ€™s a lump in my throat. Iâ€™ve googled and realised how serious it can be and now Iâ€™m terrified but scared to go doctor. What do I do Iâ€™m not calling police and I am not going to any hospital. I will go to doctor if they are sensitive about it,1

"Through work I have been in some dodgy situations abroad. A number of times my life has been at risk, and I've had to defend myself a few times. I'm a civilian and have only had basic weapon training. &#x200B; We've always had an ex-military security contractor with us, but still had to perform aggressive roles when approached.",1
"If anything goes wrong, sexually, I want to cease to exist, and a lot of the time, I'm not able to do it out of sheer anxiety. I used to be a very soft person, and I hope I'm still kind, but now I'm quicker to anger, and I don't want to become an abuser. Basically... was I abused? Does that sound like something an abused person would say? I feel like I have the symptoms of PTSD.",1
"I really donâ€™t know what to do about this, and Iâ€™m wondering if Iâ€™m even able to get over this fear. A traumatic experience compounded it in me as a kid, and Iâ€™ve been experiencing it for so long that it feels like second nature. Itâ€™s lkkely so ingrained with me that therapy wonâ€™t do much good. I need some help. If anyone can offer some, feel free.",1
"November has been one of the worst months in a long time. My mom was in a car accident and has no idea how she's getting to work. A few days later my grandmother died and I didn't even have enough money to attend the funeral. I drove home to be with my family, and to drive my mom 5 hours to the airport. I spent a ton on gas and now money is tight.",1
Also the headaches. LOADS of headaches all the time. Iâ€™m so done. I hate this almost as bad as my brain constantly telling me Iâ€™m a POS. Anxiety is fun :),1
I am really feeling like there are no good men. They are all just horrible to women. I think I would rather be alone than deal with any man again. Has anyone else felt like this? Did your feelings ever change?,1
"You can see the detail on my [update 2 right <url> and here's a link to the [project github <url> So I'm begging you here, literally begging you. If there's anyone out there who would be kind enough to give me a second chance to fix my fuck up and finish my degree, would you please consider giving me some financial aid via [my goFundMe <url> I'm literally in dire need of help right here and I don't know where else to turn other than the people of the internet :( ***Kind regards,",1
"Did I mention my parents are religious? I don't know if this is normal for religious people to treat. Whenever I tell them I'm terrified of being homeless they tell me I'm a ""acting like a baby"" and ""get over it"" my parents parents did not treat them this way. They're basically mad because they(I guess 30 or 40 years ago were different when they were my age? Because they said they both lived on their own at 17 and that they find it creepy I'm 16+ and they find it creepy being around me).",1
"But it's been 2 monthsalready this time. We didn't speak for Christmas or new year. I'm lonely, sad, angry at the situation (not angry at him!) and the worst part is not being able to talk or even know what's going on. We didn't fight before this so he's not angry at me.",1
"Sorry this going to be super long, I have a lot to say... Tl;dr... see title. It was constant up and down; one minute we were happy and he was being more affectionate than he has in years, the next he's screaming at me and calling me a whore. I get it, I broke him. I feel so disgusted and ashamed with myself but I truly want to spend my life with no one else.",1
"And it makes me more anxious which causes me to slip up *more*. It's getting WORSE though. I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit. She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck... I know they noticed.",1
"Our dog Jett has been diagnosed with diabetes and is now in the hospital to stabilize his blood sugar. Luckily, he seems to be doing well and he will be home with us soon. Unfortunately, his bill is large enough that we just can't cover it on our own (especially with our poor financial situation). We're being evicted from our home soon and trying to find a place with this bill is just too much for us by ourselves. [To help us with the bill, we set up a GoFundMe <url>",1
"I didn't do anything during spring break, except maybe go to work. And even then, I missed a day because I just couldn't deal with the stress. Most adults get excited to tell you they did absolutely nothing during their break. And there was a time when I enjoyed taking a break too. But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.",1
"I feel like I will never trust my own judgement again. 3) I fucking HATE being this person. I hate being a victim. I would never judge anyone else in my situation, but I canâ€™t stand having to see myself as someone who was abused. My grandfather abused my grandmother her whole marriage and I always felt like, because of that, I would always be on the lookout.",1
"Hey everyone. I need a place to vent and place my feelings because I don't know what to do anymore. This evening while playing a boardgame with my BF and some friends, I found out my BF lied big time. Short: last year we decided that I would join him this year on his skiing trip with his friends (his idea). This wasn't possible in the end (or so he told me) because his friends didn't want to rent a cabin but go on a cheap student skiing trip.",1
Iâ€™ve been leaving lights on at night both in the main rooms and my bedroom. The fear is both physical and emotional. Iâ€™m so jumpy at work and at home. I feel like Iâ€™m seeing things everywhere and little waves of panic wash through me all day. Iâ€™m really just finding this incredibly difficult right now and needed to write it out I guess.,1
"Why would you say that to me"" and gets extremely offended. He continues on by giving me the silent treatment for 50 minutes and then comes in the room and tells me ""You don't understand me. No one understands me. I give up. On everything.""",1
"She was already against smoking weed after college at first but now she seems to have moved to a stance where she's okay with me smoking weed as long as she's there when it happens, as in I could smoke with just her or when we're both hanging out with the same friends. I've tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she can't seem to describe it rationally, saying that it's a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her. I don't know how to explain this to her. I don't want to give up the option of smoking weed with friends but I don't want to break up with her over something like this because I love her.",1
"I'm worried I have a blood clot or something that gets aggravated when I wear them. I just want to be okay and to have a good time on this trip, but I've been so out of it, and I'm at my wit's end. Right now I'm lying down and I feel blood rushing all through my head, and bulging of blood vessels around my nose. I'm extremely sleep deprived and woozy but I'm scared to go to sleep and am in pain. I'm so scared.",1
"I have PTSD from my sexual abuse, and this week has been really hard. Really, since Dr. Ford came out against kavanaugh and the fallout of it. Today, though, was really hard. I come home to see my father watching fox news and agreeing that Dr. Ford is a lying whore. His words.",1
"And I don't ask for the nightmares to drain me of all energy and make me feel worse throughout the day the harder I try to be normal. I was planning on seeking counselling without my parent's knowledge for this condition once I get to university and get settled, but now I'm wondering if I'm going to be told the same thing by a therapist there. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.",1
"i knew gay was humiliation. i tried bringing up to my dad, and he said he wouldn't care if his son was a fudge packer, nor would he care bout that son anymore. i then had to speak to the bishop of my church and tell him about me possibly being gay. my dad was in the back of the room and another man i had never met wa sitting next to him. He asked me if i had ever had any gay encounters.",1
"I know every time I have panic attacks to remind myself it's just in my head, but it sucks when little things just make you feel like shit! Does anyone else get triggered by stupid things like this? ? I'm even just pissed at myself for now feeling mad at my mom, like don't you know not to tell someone with health anxiety that ""they don't look right""?? Ugh!",1
"In class, im always on edge, i cant focus on one thing for too long and i constantly scan my environment and I think they think im looking at them which im not. this also made it more awkward to talk to them. I been there for a month but im still very nervous around my peers and teachers. I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet  seem more at ease with other people.",1
"I know this may seem like a small thing, but to someone with these problems, it's a huge deal and to be at a store where you do not feel ""safe"" around your managers and you can't talk with them and grow as an employee, what's the point of continuing to work there? So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company. As I did mention, I have been struggling lately with some things: being slow with completing tasks on the work list is the biggest issue I believe. I'm not sure why I'm slow, in the past a supervisor has said ""Yes you're slow, but you're thorough.""",1
"I was consuming quite a lot of caffeine (up to 500mg per day) during the summer and I'm medicated with 18mg methylphenidate for ADHD. (I was rarely taking caffeine with methylphenidate together as there are a lot of side effects after doing that, one of them is anxiety and increased heart rate). I don't take methylphenidate now because of the high bp and my chest pains. I have an appointment to the cardiologyst but until then I'll have all my trial exams. I'm only 18 years old, is it really possible to have a chest angina at this age?",1
"But she says she can't stand hearing it because she's got enough on her plate as she actually suffers with depression herself.

"I'm 24 and have massive amounts of stress going on with job hunting. I live with parents who are constantly on my back and getting angry with me for not having a job. They keep trying to help me by saying ""oh this place is hiring and that place is hiring again."" I have tried all places where I live and every time I don't get an interview let alone hired. Even if they have a sign up that they are hiring, they tell me ""sorry we're not hiring right now.""",1
"When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.",1
I donâ€™t know. Was this okay? Should I hate him? Or was it just something new? I really donâ€™t know what to make of the situation.,1
Any tips for making more friends? Tl;dr: I've had very few friends throughout my life. Recently I've tried reaching out to a lot of people but almost all of them will decline my offer to hang out at some point. I guess maybe this has to do with how I am socially awkward in the past but I've also been told that I am trying too hard. Any tips for making more friends?,1
"Hello guys. This is my first post here. Ever since I can't fall asleep on a random night (few months ago) , I started getting anxiety at night and before heading to bed but everyday is different. Usually, when I get on bed n off the lights, my body started to heat up and i would sweat a little which makes me really uncomfortable. My heart would pound fast to which makes me anxious.",1
I'm completely devastated. My cat was just hit and killed by a car. I don't think I'm allowed to bury him in the garden (we rent) and I don't know what to do.

But I spend WEEKS ruminating on all the things they've said, things they might say next... and the grounding techniques that my therapist suggests never stops it. How do you distract yourself from ruminating or arguing with people in your head?",1
"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over. Each time I petitioned her to stop, she would become very visible distressed. She spent a lot of time talking about suicide. During the school year, we exchanged letters every day at school that, in retrospect, sounded a lot like love letters from her part, but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point, and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.",1
"I got 6 stitches. My parents love my bf and in fact, my mom and him are so close that they go on walks and go to the movies together. I felt uncomfortable and unwanted by his family. To be fair, I was also a little closed off with them but mainly because I felt so unwanted. I have put on some weight, which I am sure his dad noticed because he absolutely hates fat people.",1
I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things. When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked. Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me.,1
"This sends me into an extreme anxiety spiral, because I'd been seeing his mother almost every weekend for nearly five years, and she does this at the drop of a hat. I understand she was just trying to protect her son, but the level of nastiness was just insane. I had to get our old counsellor - mine and N's - involved to speak to her. She said the mother is taking things seriously. I don't believe it.",1
"I have four kids full time, almost a year ago their dad was removed because of substantial abuse. It's been incredibly hard making ends meet by myself and although I get rent paid, all other bills are stuck on the back burner. Our electric bill is over $400 and they're demanding $225 as a minimum payment. It's scheduled for disconnect today and I can't put it off any longer. I know it's a long shot but seriously needing a miracle at the moment.",1
"I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.",1
"(Hurt the ego, but whatever, I guess you're not always gonna be the hottest guy she's ever been with.) Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her, because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up, and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",1
"There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those who wanna get to the point this gets kinda lengthy. Hi, I'm 19 and this is my first time posting here and I'm hoping at least one person can relate. Before a few months ago I never had to deal with anxiety really, but out of nowhere it hit me like a truck. I guess what's been causing it is relationship issues, but mostly health anxiety. My first major mistake was googling symptoms I started having, not realizing that it was normal for anxiety to cause physical symptoms.",1
"I've tried getting new glasses, but that didn't help. Blood work came back fine. I have tried medication but only helped with anxiety not focusing issue. Some days I just straight out can't focus. Luckily, when I'm on auto-pilot and distracted, I can get a lot done.",1
"Sorry for such a jumbled mess of a post. Edit: I realize I never expanded on the dissociation or depression. Because of my dissociation, while he was being abusive he would often say things like, ""You're just remembering wrong. (gaslighting/rewriting history)"" ""You have bad memory. That never happened.""",1
"But there you were, laughing and being affectionate with your newest victim. Same dark hair, same bubbly personality. She's a prettier, skinnier version of me. Everything you made me believe I needed to be but could never change. I was visibly shaking as I tried to remain calm in front of the new guy I have been dating.",1
My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up. But the anxiety swirls to the point i keep trying to find where i went wrong. It replays and plays in my head over and over like a horror movie. The feeling of wanting to die because at that point i had nothing left.,1
Im 13 years old and except for school i never go outside i usually spend the whole day on the computer just watching videos on youtube and stuff but at the end of the day i get depressed and feel like i'm wasting my life. I have friends but i also have severe social anxiety and i always feel as if my friends are just putting up with me. I feel depressed and lonely. I never spend time with friends and when i do i feel as if they don't want to hang out with me as we never do anything pls reply if i'm not alone,1
My chest has a different feeling. Before it would feel on fire and chaotic. Now it feels just wrong. Like I am in medical danger. I am a 26 year old woman.,1
He keeps going back to her. He even cleans up the messes she makes when she smashes his stuff. He has dropped all of his dreams because she doesn't approve of them. Sorry for the long post but it sucks hearing that he is in this situation and we just want our friend back so he can recover from this. He used to be the funniest and happiest guy around and now he is just broken.,1
"My Father has been struggling with alcoholism for nearly his entire life, he hasnâ€™t been in contact with myself, my mom, or my sister in years. I guess it all of sudden caught up with him, he past away from a heart attack recently. It still doesnâ€™t feel real, but my girlfriends family has been nothing but supportive throughout the whole thing and helped me grieve through his death. Needless to say, I do not want to attend a funeral or memorial, because Iâ€™d like to remember the good times I had with him and not being up bad memories. I had a rough child hood, he cheated on my mother, he wasnâ€™t a great guy.",1
"I know there are a lot of bad stories on here about therapy. But I was wondering about good experiences. My own experience was six weeks ago. I slipped and went on s bender, I fell into a depressive, suicidal crisis. I phoned every crisis line that exists, for ten hours, well getting drunker and drunker.",1
"Like the title says, Iâ€™m rapidly losing motivation. I recently switched collages to be closer to home, so I could be closer to family. And my depressive spirals are coming more often, mainly because of the lack of work I do. I always end up doing things at the last damn minute. My freshman year I tried my best, almost.",1
"I barely slept in the hospital because I stayed up at night and listened for codes with his room number. I was terrified, constantly living in fear from the moment I awoke until about his 7th day in the hospital when he seemed clearer, and sat up with assistance for the first time. Fast forward to now. We are lucky to be alive, and we are injured. Weâ€™ve been robbed of a normal engagement, of the experience of moving in together, and thatâ€™s a grieving process...but my mind...is not what it was.",1
Now I know everyone is going to maybe think it's from the suboxone but it or at least used to be one of the things that helped my anxiety. If I admitted myself I am afraid they'd admit me and make me go cold turkey. I am unemployed and looking for employment. I live with my grandparents. I'm a 28 year old male.,1
"Strangely enough, I had buried all this. But when my parents also failed to realise that my sister was on meth and neglecting her children, who are very dear to me, it sort of doubled the trauma and now I have full blown trauma. I feel like my parents just aren't trustworthy. How can they live in such an oblivious bubble? I wouldn't put any faith in them to protect me now and feel that I'm in this world on my own.",1
I don't even know that I feel lonely. I was fine with all this until my boyfriend asked out of concern because he thought maybe I was depressed or something and pushing everyone away. Then it was like he knocked down a wall inside me that I didn't know was there and revealed a whole room full of cobwebs. I feel ashamed and defective and hopeless now. But I don't know what to do.,1
"I'm a senior and  I'm starting to go through the college application process and I just feel so overwhelmed. I haven't even finished my college list, started ny essays or supplemental or filed my FAFSA. Not to mention I'm doing EA so I have a sooner deadline. I haven't visited any colleges and me ecs are so bad. God I just want this to be over with.",1
"I am so confused! Why is he playing these games? I have made it clear I want him back and to me itâ€™s like he has feelings but is unwilling to say anything? TL;DR Iâ€™ve been dating a guy for a few months, we split up over a silly petty argument, since weâ€™ve split up heâ€™s been maintaining that he wanted us to break up but heâ€™s checking in on me and asking what Iâ€™m doing. Is he just being controlling or does he have feelings still?",1
"â€œEither be my girlfriend or be out of my lifeâ€ my fwb told me. I refused to be his girlfriend so of course, now weâ€™re strangers. Itâ€™s breaking my heart. I want him in my life so badly, as a friend that is. We had a wonderful connection thatâ€™s hard to come by (at least for me) and I hate to lose that.",1
"I am ignoring him, that's not what this post is about. Basically, after all this time my ex has recently, decided he ""knows"" I cheated on him our entire relationship [I didn't], ""knows"" I'm this chick online who post XXX pictures of herself [I'm not] and has ""reminded"" me of incidences of our relationship that has literally never happened. Like, for one example *""...that time I called you from jail, and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help...""* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)... He's literally fabricating things out of thin air and claiming they happened. He isn't denying that he was an abuser, but he's saying like ""You were bad too!",1
"I'm just scared to death. I have anxiety problems which are probably contributing to it. But he keeps telling me he'd never judge me for anything and my sister said if he's OK with a missing tooth, he should be OK with a gap. I'm worried he'll see me and change his mind about me and I don't know what to do. Should I tell him about it first or just see what happens?",1
This has made me really question where I am and if I should be staying put. Sort of if where I was was right I wouldn't be feeling like this is now. I'm not thinking I should leave for the sake of being single to see someone else but maybe if I'm not as happy as I thought I should be leaving for me to have some time and space to do things on my own. Any suggestions reddit? **tl;dr my crush on my driving instructor is making me think about leaving my boyfriend**,1
"I have had the worst anxiety of my life recently. As a college student I am now falling behind in classes, forgetting about sorority events and not interacting with my friends. I am slowly losing my mind. My room is a mess and the only thing keeping me out of a mental hospital right now is literally my students where I student teach. I am exhausted of fighting to get out of bed everyday, shaking when I sit in class and just not talking to anyone.",1
If I hadnâ€™t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both. I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names. I held my hands over the childrenâ€™s ears so they couldnâ€™t hear. But at least he didnâ€™t hit me. I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didnâ€™t need to hear my voice.,1
"I feel like I'm going to go insane. I can't stop crying or wanting to pull my hair out or screaming. I can't stop shaking. I'm on medications for anxiety and they help some but not much and not often... Ultimately, I know I'm not me anymore.",1
"Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep. Coincidentally, it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes, so kinda like a vicious circle. Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears. My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.",1
"I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1
"My current boyfriend wasn't right, just a figure of the coma induced illusion. The only voice that seemed remotely really was my best friend, she's one of the few regular poodle I still have contact from that time. After a hour of my boyfriend, my best friend and my other partner working with me, I slowly started coming to some balanced sembelrnce of reality. Now I'm scared to go back to sleep. My ex, who abused me for 11 years, might be waiting tight there for me again.",1
"I know I should tell her my doubts, because I know she's gone through doubts before as well. But I also don't know if now I'm just second guessing because I'm just generally concerned about the future. Above all I just have no idea what to do.   ---   **tl;dr**: living long distance, dealing with chronic wedding anxiety and fear about impact of children, fantasizing about others, and hoping for insight from people who have been through similar experiences.",1
"I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word. If someone asked me if I was, I'd deny it but I know I have PTSD and I guess that does make me ill by definition. Will I be considered mentally ill forever?",1
"He has been my best friend since the first day we met, he treats me great, he is always loving, not at all selfish, etc. We rarely fight and have only had maybe 2 other big arguments which we worked out. I am just so hurt over what he said to me. Do I just let it go and move forward with his apology? Like I said, itâ€™s  not like either of us ever drink and the only reason we made it a point to drink so much was because I spent so much on the alcohol package for vacation.",1
"I would like to leave there, but I'm terrified of a shelter. I'm also a semi observant Jewish woman. Most shelters won't help me keep kosher and keep Shabbat, both of which are important to me. The Rachel Coalition is for domestic violence only, so I can't go there. The NCJW shelter in the area doesn't accept the voucher welfare would offer me.",1
"Itâ€™s only happened 3/4 times recently but Iâ€™ve been putting off having sex and Iâ€™m constantly worried that my girlfriend doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m into her or that Iâ€™m losing interest, and so on. Iâ€™ve only just mentioned to her that I might be struggling with some form of anxiety. Itâ€™s a vicious circle at the moment. Itâ€™s almost as if I canâ€™t relax and if I have nothing to worry about I create something to worry about. What do you guys think?",1
One of the couples has a four-year-old daughter. We live in a two bedroom apartment. I constantly have to do shit for these people. One of the wives scolds me  constantly and tells me I need to show more respect for my parents. They leave needles out everywhere and when I inevitably step on one I'll probably end up with an STD.,1
"I hate the thought that even after my mom's death she still has power over me. Anyways, I've come here for advice on meds, specifically if this sounds like a good place to start. I used to just focus on the anxiety and insomnia acutely but never really tried to treat the source. I'm starting Effexor XR, Prazosin for the horrendous nightmares and continuing on clonazepam for panic attacks. Thanks guys!",1
"My father has: Keys to a fancy car, like 5 fancy bikes, an iPad, member of a fitness center, goes to the sauna regularily, other women... Needless to say, they should just break up immediately, right? Well, it should be that simple, but my mother resists for some reason. We had this situation countless times, where she was like, I cannot cope with this anymore, let's find another place to live in, until you find something for yourself, and when things are about to happen, she goes nah, I don't know... Which is so frustrating to hear after a while. Even more so, when he says things like HE decides when or if they split up.",1
"**How can I move to a more mature kind of love that is less focused on me and my fears, and instead more about him and our relationship? **   ---   **tl;dr**: Feeling like I am being selfish and immature, mostly focusing on my needs of distance and validation and less on those of my LDR bf. Worrying about the possibility that we might not like each other that much anymore once we live together for a while.",1
PS: I can't get fired because one she is in another department which doesn't break policy and I am in good working and personal relations with my direct boss and the one above him.   ---   **tl;dr**: Started having sex with a co-worker 8 months ago. Found out today that she is married and that some of our sexual partners were also married. What should I do?,1
"and then proceeded to show me the video of the ""dumb girlfriend"" struggling to answer the question. Needless to say, I was pissed. I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?",1
"I also have no family. I was abused for my disabilities as a child, including murder attempts, so I cannot turn to my family for help. I have friends helping me with food and transportation because I am poor and disability aid is barely enough to eat a meal a day. I have food stamps that work for about a week or week and a half of groceries so that's already really helpful. I live in a small, worn down appartement with no heating and thays why I am so cold.",1
"I specifically told my father NOT to lose my money gambling. I'm not that depressed since I sort of expected this to happen, but I am still severely disappointed. I am literally continuing to lose respect for my own father. Of course, it isn't so much the money, but rather that he would do this to me when I told him not to. I fear that if this continues, my father will continue to waste away his own life as well as damage mine.",1
"He came to the door, drunk and high on opiates (heâ€™s an ex H addict, opiate rage is real), he told me, verbatim, that if there was a guy in the house, heâ€™d kill him on the spot, no questions asked. That was a pretty easy night. Iâ€™ve spent countless nights barricaded in my bedroom because of his rage. His past is terrible. Grew up in gangs (Mexican Mafia) and molested at a young age.",1
"I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, I just didn't need it. Long story short, something's flipped in my head the last couple of weeks and my libido is very much back, worryingly so, I'm not sure what to do with it lol. So we've had more sex in the past 7 days than the preceding 7 years....but it's still very much for him. I don't know what I want and I don't know how to ask for what I want. It's been so freaking long since I considered sex as a thing it actually makes me nervous.",1
"The fact is that it is not very common, these numbers, from where I come from] tl;dr - unable to overcome girlfriend's past. In two minds regarding breaking up. She says she will die without me [already popped up a cocktail of pills once. Nothing happened.]",1
"Worse than that develop the same anxiety disorder. Again another reason to finish the relationship. I really love her but cannot and WILL NOT embarrass her like I did at the wedding. My plan is to go talk to a private physiatrist and see what they think. I donâ€™t believe medication is the only answer but if it helps in conjunction with therapy, a healthy lifestyle and meditation then I will try it.",1
"I apologized for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a ""retarded"" voice. So, is our relationship doomed?   ---   **tl;dr**: My bf and I fight too much, and I think it's both our faults while he thinks it's only mine/my brain chemistry's fault. Am I crazy, or do we need to break up?",1
"Sure it was almost 3 years ago (in July) two months into my first job out of university. I got bit in the leg and continued on like it was nothing. I only fell apart October 2016. I must have been living in survival mode until I got the call that the man who saved my life was getting recognized with a bravery award. Hearing those words, I literally felt my chest rip open and haven't been able to close the wound since.",1
"I've always connected my self worth with how well I do in school. Right now, I'm failing the last class I need to graduate.

Hey. First time posting here. I have been living in my car with my brother and cat since May. I am feeling extremely depressed/defeated right now hence why I'm posting here. I'll start from the beginning.,1
I typically would not care in the slightest about things like that but I feel as if since my good friends basically turned their backs on me that I am at a loss? If my good friends did before does that mean everyone else will too? **TLDR: GF and I broke up. She is trying to turn people against me. What can I do?,1
"EVERY TIME I say, ""I've got a job!"" she gives me some kind of bullshit reason the place is not a good idea. She threatened to boot me back out on the street for ""not taking her word for it"" when I explain I need the job anyway. BTW her girlfriend owns the house. They've lived here together for 2 years and she has been making up bullshit reasons she can't work the whole time.",1
"I am currently only using 5-htp once a week, i get no benefit when i use it daily. I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life. Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it). It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me. they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean.",1
"I do not know if I ought to, to be honest. I determined to quit drinking nine months ago, and have been sober seven weeks. But I never had any desire to quit grass, and I still don't. But I am in trauma therapy for the last four months, and my therapist has brought it up a number of times. She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety.",1
"I want to be able to deal with these feelings and move on. Iâ€™ve talked briefly to a counsellor on the phone but besides talking about it making me cry, it hasnâ€™t made me feel better. This is one of the worst PTSD episodes of my life. I canâ€™t predict how long this is going to go on and Iâ€™m sick of the weak, dissolving feeling I get whenever I think about it. Iâ€™ve been trying to replace bad thoughts with good, Iâ€™ve tried CBT techniques, Iâ€™ve tried wallowing in the bad thoughts (as advised by someone over at r/emetophobia)... nothing has worked, Iâ€™m a mess.",1
"So what I am asking is someone or somebody's to help me with the rest of the repair cost. The repair is 575 dollars, I have about 200 of that currently, I need to get this done soon before I am stuck on the side of the road with a broken down vehicle and spending unnecessary money on Ubers or Lyft. I'm willing to pay back monthly with acceptable interest until it's paid in full. I get paid bi-weekly at my full time job. Thanks in advance!",1
"Sorry in advance for what I'm getting off me chest. This man sexually, physically, and emotionally abused me for a year. He even tried to marry me at 16 so he could trap me in his perverted hell. After four months of completely breaking free of this sick, twisted human being he had the gall to contact one of my friends to try to get a vinyl back. He treated me like a dog.",1
"But recently I went on a car journey with my friends and 5 minutes before we got to the destination I started panicking because I thought I needed a wee and took a valium (completely embarrassed myself in-front of my friends). once we got to the destination I was actually fine and didn't really need one that bad. Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear. I'm so annoyed at myself that this is starting to control my life.",1
"I don't know who I'm meant to talk to but I can't breathe. I can barely get out of bed or check my phone without panicking. But I'm always checking my phone in case someone messages me. I don't have it on loud because I don't like the noise. Yet my job requires me to always be reachable and the staff under me always ask me to help them, but I can't even help myself.",1
12. End of January I just didn't have any way to get enough money and we collapse with an eviction process started. 13. Working with friends and others we managed to get the money right after the judgement was issues for eviction. This stopped the eviction but we still had a judgement.,1
"My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
"This has begun to bother me since I do try to please her and go out of my way to have a little foreplay but she never really returns that favor. It has become a one sided physical relationship. I've even had multiple times where I have trouble getting it up, and its largely due to the fact that I receive no physical stimulation prior to intercourse. We've known each other a year and been officially dating for about 9 months. I finally decided to say something a month ago because it was really beginning to bother me because I'd hoped she'd slowly overcome these fears with time but she seems to be content with how things were and not going to change.",1
"I was freaking out. I stood on my back porch for about 30 minutes hyperventilating before I could convince myself that ""I am in control!"" I was embarrassing ! I couldn't believe that I allowed myself to get so worked up. But it was not as embarrassing as It/ I would soon be.....",1
"Every day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough. Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.",1
"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.  He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1
"When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didnâ€™t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades. Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1
"I'm afraid about what they may do next, what they might say to me next, what they might ask me next. I just want to be by myself, in my own place, with my computer, my keyboard, my guitar, and my bed. I'm a teen, so I don't really have that choice, but to be honest, nobody really does, no matter  how old they are. You always have to be around people for one reason or another. I'm just never comfortable around people anymore.",1
"For no reason, I'll just wake up with anxiety like feelings. Stomach ache, uneasiness, some sort of dread, or feeling like any little thing would bring me over the edge and have a panic attack. I don't understand why and it can last for a long time. Anyways. Sometimes the breathing exercises help take the edge off it, but it doesn't fully help.",1
"All these sexual abuse accusations, while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse, I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.",1
I keep on getting crap from non work people about oh just fly. I try to psyche myself up to do it but after the 5 minutes of feeling like â€œyeah I can do itâ€ I feel beyond tense. Anyone been in a similar spot? What did you end up doing? Thanks!,1
Iâ€™ve put my family through it too many times and itâ€™s putting a strain on my relationship. Iâ€™m not who I used to be. And because of that Iâ€™m afraid people are going to leave me. My partner especially. Heâ€™s seen me go through this before and Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™s going to give up on me.,1
"I donâ€™t know that. I think Iâ€™m responsible for all of it. For the perpetrators, for the abuse, for the dysfunction, for my depression, my suicidal ideation, my pathetic life. All of it. Iâ€™m responsible.",1
"My boyfriend and I generally have a good relationship. We've lived together for about a year and a half, and we have a pretty good partnership going. He's the first guy I've been with who is willing to sit down and really hash things out if we're having an issue. However there is one topic he *won't* hash out with me, and that's that sometimes he asks me questions out of no where that to me feel kind of like little ""pop quizzes"" that I feel are designed to try to catch me off guard and stump me. He'll randomly pose a riddle or ask a logic question, then I kind of fumble because I feel like I have to come up with an answer quickly, or I just get exasperated and tell him I'm not in the mood for a pop quiz.",1
When I try to befriend artists or thinkers or doers. They often either shun me because my work has been sub par and nearly non existant and they don't see me as equal. Or they show sexual/romantic interest I don't reciprocate which makes me nervous and avoidant. Sometimes I am shunmed I think because they mistake my interest in making friends for a romantic interest. I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.,1
Cut to yesterday... My parents booked me in for an emergency appointment with the DR because my anxiety and depression is so bad I cannot function day to day and spend most of my time stuck in bed panicking. I was prescribed 2mg Valium to go alongside my anti-depressants. I took one and within 15 minutes I went from SEVERE anxiety to COMPLETE calmness Well... here comes the paranoia associated with my bad cannabis trip years ago... I FREAKED.,1
"He says he doesnâ€™t remember this happening. But he has a short fuse as it is. Heâ€™s temperamental, out of work, depressed, has a family history of substance abuse, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2. I truly believed this would be â€œrock bottomâ€ and serve as a wake up call to turn his life around. It wasnâ€™t.",1
"She didn't go home with me, she took an Uber. It was the worst 30 minutes of my life. I payed for the food, got it to go, and went home. This is where it gets crazy. I wanted to be away from her at that time.",1
"I don't know if I'm able to do that, since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with. I will say that my doctor very clearly didn't believe me at my follow up appointment, but my bf was in the waiting room. So I didn't admit to anything. I was teary eyed, however. From anyone's experience- is it worth it to go to the police?",1
"I don't want to leave my house because I know that everyone knows what she's saying about me and EVERYONE BELIEVES IT. this was all over the fact I blocked her because she was toxic. I'm losing it, Reddit. I'm losing my mind. I can't stop crying i can't eat, all I've been thinking about is killing myself.",1
"Hi everyone, This is my first post in this thread, so bear with me. My mother (54F) has always been controlling and anxious, and now that I (19F) have gone to college, it feels like things have gotten worse. I am home right now for winter break and things have been so tense and awful and I don't know what to do. She is really judgmental and anxious about my sex life.",1
"But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family. Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day.",1
at some point they laughed and i had to leave because i got physically sick to my stomach. i guess i didn't realize how much they had screwed me up. now i feel like shit though because the acquaintance is a nice person and i want to be friends with them. we were all planning a dnd game together over text for a while and i just want to be able to talk to them without thinking about my ex. any solutions or help ideas?,1
"I have therapy sessions scheduled but at the moment, I'm currently looking for some advice and insights. The only time I feel 'comfortable in my own skin' is when I'm drunk and or stoned. I, in the past have been ridiculed for an effeminate walk, been erroneously suspected of being gay and I have an effate look. Perhaps this facial look is a projection of my despair and a subconscious psychosomatic cry for help. I'm in my late twenties and have yet to accomplish anything of significance.",1
"I've been through treatment and had a period of relative health for a stretch. Then I had a bunch of new trauma experiences. I'm 5 or so years out from the last experiences and have moved 800 miles away, completely cut off from all former contacts with the exception of one close friend. The move helped for a while, then it hit with vengeance. Panic attacks, ruminating, depression, anger, the whole deal.",1
"And one of the girls pull me and asks me if I like him and I said yeah and she goes â€œif you like him you can have him because my friend is only here for one night...(gets pulled). And there I was in a packed nightclub all on my own. Trying not to cry about the fact I got ditched by my date for the night. So I leave the club go home on the train with the worst feeling ever, more insecure than Iâ€™ve ever been. **tl;dr : one of the worst feelings Iâ€™ve ever had in my life (sorry for being dramatic)**",1
"Bottom line is this is the first situation in a long while causing me to really get anxious. I'm thinking about it most of the time and waffling about it. And today I got the invitation and started looking into flights and transport and I'm overwhelmed. I'm at an age where traveling alone shouldn't be a big deal, but it is, I never have traveled alone aside from a handful of 2 hr bus trips in 2007ish. Any advice?",1
"We need a motel. We need advice. My grandson will end up leaving preschool, because we don't have a car and won't know where to have his bus pick him up if we do a shelter. He also has a standing dentist appointment every Monday this month. I hate that he has to go through this and not have a home to recover in.",1
The silent sadness that you feel for no apparent reason yet somehow you feel too weak or too much of a pussy to do anything about it or even think that you deserve better because you feel like you deserve whatever painful feeling you are going through You feel like you rather suffer a long and painful life rather than ending your life because you feel like you deserve whatever agony you are going through The anxiety and panic attack come and go whenever they please. __________________________________________________________ Sometimes it feels like you somehow been hit by an invisible truck and your body is as frozen as it somebody turned you into a popsicle and you have no other choice but shake from the inside.,1
"As I recover, I am in a great deal of conflict. I am scared to remember that year. I am frightened of what might be there. And I feel guilty for not remembering that year, too. I go way down the rabbithole, sometimes, wondering if I am crazy and nothing happened and my ex was right, because there are so many things I can't remember, now.",1
"                                                 She resents my relationship with our son - My son is a Daddy's boy. Even now as I type this I hear him out there waiting for me saying Daddy Daddy Daddy. He comes and gives me hugs when I come home and barely notices when my wife is gone or comes home. - â€ŽThis is also something she's recently admitted and I feel guilty about it, but I feel like it's because she puts in no effort beyond what she needs to do.",1
I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice. He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat. An example would be at Darvin furniture one time. He takes me and my sister there and tells her to pick out a desk. I look at a $100 discount desk and he says we don't have enough money.,1
I can't stop the ruminating thoughts about the whole process. I also can't stop the what if's or I should have done more. I keep blaming myself and beating myself up. It sometimes makes me physically sick. Do you have any tips to help alleviate the pain and stop the thoughts?,1
"Both of these were poor choices. It just exacerbated the situation. I had vases, game controllers, tv remote, coffee mugs, etc thrown at me on varied encounters. This is not an exaggerated list..  I tried to leave and she blocked the door with her body, threatening to kill herself on one such occassion.",1
"They are very sweet and welcoming to me, but I feel so overwhelmed with everything. I feel as though I gave up my independence to come here, which is fine, but I'm having a really hard time adjusting to everything being handed to me when I've had to provide for myself for so long. I told my boyfriend that I need supplies for the week and he responded with ""ask my mom"". I couldn't wrap my mind around that. I still cant.",1
"Most of 2017, I stayed at around 135 and have been really good about hiding my fat with very flattering clothes but over the last 3 months, I have gained 15lbs as a result of traveling for work, moving to a new city and the holidays. I have always been very unhappy with the way I look and I envy girls who are slim. I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.",1
He admitted to using the social media of girls he knows to get off. He even admitted to using his ex's nudes to get off. He downloads that specific app and then usually deletes it. He forgot today. We have sex 1-3 times a day.,1
"In his own ways I know he loves me but he's double my body weight, he's a weight lifter, and he has blind rage that only comes out on me of all people . If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me. I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY? I like to believe that he knows his limits when we're fighting but he has scared me and himself in the past. Now that chokings are happening during every incident, the accidents could be irreversible.",1
"Anyway, I feel like maybe I should talk to someone, but I have no idea how to even bring it up with my doctor. How does that work? Do I just march in and say ""Hey Dr, I think maybe I have PTSD.""? Just sounds weird. EDIT: Also want to throw in here that I'm not interested in being medicated",1
"She humiliates me in front of other people and when we're alone. I'm always just a servant who's there to get her drinks and hype her up. I'm always just the butt of her jokes. She used to invite me over when she was hanging out with a guy she was trying to hook up with, just so she could make fun of me in front of him the whole time to make herself look better and/or cooler. I'm just a prop.",1
We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-heâ€™s leaving in about 15 minutes. Iâ€™m really scared and I think heâ€™ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so weâ€™re probably going to have to get a restraining order. Considering weâ€™re a financially unstable family this is going to majorly impact the way we live. We live in a two bedroom apartment so weâ€™re probably going to have to move to a studio or anything else thatâ€™s cheaper. My brother leaves in 2 days because he has to go back to college and we need to take action when heâ€™s here because me and my mom canâ€™t really go against my dad (physically).,1
"We ate and he was monitoring my data use because I sent some photos to our friend of her baby shower. And he said he ""hates having to watch over me like a father and he wishes I was more responsible"" but said that he ""accepts that this is the way I am"" I said nothing in response to this and just ate my food and let it slide, smiled at him and small talked. We got back to the park and they had put out a new sign saying they were closed for the rest of the day. This made him even more mad.",1
"My girlfriend does have PTSD. She said that she thought that I might have it because of an incident that occurred in 2014. You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason, the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event, not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust.",1
"I have never before felt so betrayed by the system. Fiance (f) was blackout drunk. She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5"" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked over the next 5 minutes. All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time). As I got scared she would seriously hurt me, or I would strike her back, I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.",1
I even pressed chargers against him. Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it. Nothing has happened since June and Iâ€™m about to be moving far away from him. I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still. I donâ€™t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,1
I have been reluctant to start one of these as I am really ashamed to ask for help. One of my dear friends suggested I do this as I really do not have anywhere else to ask for assistance right now. I am at a high risk for homelessness. Landlord now wants me out unless I can come up with $800 in the next couple of days. I also was recently kicked off of food stamps lately for no apparent reason and I am working to get that fixed.,1
"As much of an asshole I know it makes me, I simply can't put my heart into a relationship in which I know I'm not the father of her child. I was ghosted this past summer by one of few people I've ever wanted to have a relationship with, and the subsequent weeks were a quest to find sex that would distract me from the pain. Others came before, but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future, and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me, and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.",1
"so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day. With the switch to xanax ive gone back to my old ways of hiding away, crying, not eating, and have almsot purchased cigarettes again(quit smoking about 10 months ago).",1
"I'm taking care of her but I have no idea what to do with myself. **TL;DR: My wife told her co-worker that she and I were in an open relationship and started hooking up with him. She said it's because I have too high a libido, because our relationship lost it's newness, and because I don't do a fair share of housework. I'm not sure if we can work it out or if I should just leave. **",1
I can't take a shower and I haven't eaten today. I am sitting in my car and almost on empty. I keep ending up with abusive men who pretend to love me and my kids then hurt us. I am on a waiting list for housing but no call backs yet. The kids are safe and good and I go see them every few days til I have a place.,1
"Does anyone have any advice? I feel pretty hopeless right now. I want desperately to be with my partner, and I suspect even if our relationship ends I will always love and care for him very much. I don't want to spend my life wishing I was with him, but be too overcome with my anxiety and fear to do so. It is discouraging to feel as though my ex-boyfriend is still inside my head and controlling my life.",1
"My main thing lately is that everything is making me feel overwhelmed and stressed out even in non-stressful situations, just every day life. I have a good life that is a lot less stressful than most but it seems to cause me a lot more stress than it would to anyone else like my wife for example. I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned. I've always had an idea in my head that I would do anything and everything to avoid taking medications and I've been convinced that I can deal with this on my own and if I can't then I'm doing something wrong.",1
"I've told her each time to stop, she apologised but doesn't see what the big deal is because she ""hasn't been in love with me for a long time."" This is when I started to feel awful. I can't fully figure out why though because Im not in love with her - I probably hate her and haven't realised it yet. I just feel terrible. I can barely get out of bed to go to uni.",1
"Iâ€™ve had a some fucked shit happen to me. I'm not going into detail because I'm not looking for sympathy. Today is the last day I have to pay or quit. I donâ€™t have anyone to help and Iâ€™ve exhausted all my other options applying for loans, pawning things, etc. I need to somehow come up with 1,490.46 by 6 pm.",1
"So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage. At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation. I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone. But I also want to hate him and leave. So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?",1
"! I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from. I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it! ! EDIT 2 ..",1
"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point. My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they werenâ€™t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my â€œmumâ€ They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and Iâ€™ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but Iâ€™m uncomfortable with how happy she is that heâ€™s ill, Iâ€™ve not really spoken to her about it because sheâ€™s the one that suffered not me so I canâ€™t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1
"He seemed satisfied with this and kept pouring me drinks. Eventually he decided to close up for the night and I went back up to the house, tipsy and confused about what had just happened, but glad I had bargained some time. I got myself on the dole and the rope that was against my neck seemed to loosen just a little bit. However I was still in the prison of depression and plagued by self-destructive tendencies. Although I had some more regular income I would often binge on the euphoria of having money (I was still a teenager after all), spend too much in my mania and then quickly sink into paranoia and avoidance when rent day came along.",1
"He suddenly wanted to have a relationship with her, which I saw as a good thing. I said he could come over to visit as often as he wanted, he just needs to tell me before hand so I can be home. We decided to give our relationship another shot and I got pregnant again immediately. We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid. He seems to love his kid very much but has no concept of taking responsibility.",1
"They are always calling me for everything, I don't even wanna answer my phone, but if I don't I may get yelled at. It has happened. I have spent many days and nights in tears because of the stress of this job, and even one morning, threw a bit of a fit when our dm made me come in  because there was another evaluation on my day off. I had to cancel all my plans that day to go in. I couldn't stop myself.",1
"And I'm just really confused and don't know how to feel or what to believe or think. Did he kill himself because of me? Did he know I wanted to see him or did they simply never told him? Is it my fault he is dead now, and that my little brother has no father anymore? I'm just so confused and overcome with emotions right now.",1
"She told me she had one more person to interview and that she would get back to me by Monday. I shook her hand and rushed out the store to another place and went to their restroom. I ruined my hair, I popped a little of my collar and unbuttoned some of my dress shirts. I added some water stains and even took advantage of a partially full cup of soda in one of the stalls. I spilled it on the rims of my shirt but not entirely.",1
"I have had mobility issues since I was twenty three following a difficult pregnancy that triggered inflammatory arthritis and fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome. Over the years I've had a few falls due to being very unsteady on my feet at the best of times, which have added to my mobility issues. My right ankle and calf are permanently injured, I have achilles tendonitis, plantar faciitis and the muscle in my calf has tightened so much due to the shortening of my tendons that my foot points instead of sitting normally. I have osteoarthritis in my right hip, which slips in the socket and causes a lot of pain, and this has all had an ongoing impact on the rest of my body as my back often spasms or locks and I have issues with a frozen shoulder that limits the use of my right arm. On top of all of this, I have kidney, liver and bladder problems.",1
"I am so scared that he will realize how fucked up and terrible I am and not want to continue things. I don't want him to go and he keeps assuring me he will not, but I am so, so scared that sometimes it is overwhelming. I feel like this is a disgrace on my part, because, logically, I know that he very much likes me and he really wants to stick around. But there's a part of me that genuinely believes I am not good enough and that I will not be enough once he realizes that. I am so fucked.",1
"He would play really loud music on the speaker. It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments. At this point we were homeless. He wouldnâ€™t get a job, and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money, if I didnâ€™t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us. He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.",1
"The husband's voice sounds like pure rage, the wife's both angry and defensive. A couple of times there were sounds of broken objects. We have never really talked (they don't speak good English), so I'm not sure how to approach them about it. Calling the police feels excessive, but I'm also worried someone might be abused. What is an appropriate thing to do here?",1
"Ive never really had a problem with my education until this semester, I feel mislead in my classes i.e (I do great on the homework and then I end up failing the tests). This has lead to me failing or doing not up to my standards in my other classes and its beginning to effect my own self worth. Instead of being confident in myself im resorting to internal hatred and just overall sadness. I am in a relationship with a very loving girlfriend but I feel that if I bring my problems into it, it could go sideways and I dont want that. Because of all of this my sleep schedule has not been exactly ideal, I usually go to bed at midnight and wake up early for class and the quality of my sleep is not what I would call good (tossing and turning and frequently waking up).",1
"My life has spiralled into a area Iâ€™m not sure I can survive in much longer. Everyone who was close to me have seemingly all decided to just pretend I donâ€™t exist right as I start my third year of Uni. My anxiety levels are usually pretty high this time of year but this last month has been the worst of my life for my emotional well-being. Iâ€™m trying so hard but Iâ€™m suffering, and the meds donâ€™t seem to be helping What do I do",1
Kick a man while he's down you sick sick fuck. I'm just trying to get advice and you delete part of my post. FUCK YOU. BURN IN HELL. People like you are why I hate this world.,1
Is this common? How did you deal with it? I want to just apologize and make things right but some of the things the other person probably forgot or were just super insignificant. I want to own up to my actions but it's hard. I assume if people find out I was a jerk they'll all hate me and I'll be an outcast and a pariah :/,1
"Hello my name is jake I am 17 years old and I need some help I'll give you a bit of back story Ever since I was 5 my mother was always drunk everdently she was an alcoholic and whenever she was drunk she got very agressive and to cut a long story short she abused me for over 8 years not only physically but mentally too and when I was 15 I finally spoke out and went to turn to the authorities but they didn't help they sent me back to my mum countless times and in then end I put myself into care I refused to go back I have been in care for a year and a couple months now but ever since just before chirstmas I've been having these night terrors ( which I have reason to believe that it is ptsd ) I have viscous flash backs of my mother doing all them things too me and I wake up screaming , sweating , and as a instinct ready to fight and it lasts for a good 15 mins which is horrible What I'm trying to get at is , is there any coping mechanisms that you can suggest because I feel useless and helpless at this point",1
"Who do I talk to at this point, the Command Equal Opportunity Officer (e-7) who basically says she will look into it but doesn't seem concerned. There is a stigma about asking for help in the Navy and it needs to change. Basically, if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep. If you go to medical and they give you meds, you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything. If you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed, anxious, or having symptoms of PTSD then you would be seperated from the Navy and sent home.",1
"I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.) I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story. I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!) and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did! It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!",1
"The next couple of days have been mostly normal. A large group of my friends were visiting so I had a good time, but that episode made me slightly anxious every now and then. I have no prior history of anxiety disorder or mental illness. For all I know, this episode could have been anything or nothing, but I do remember feeling a strong sense of anxiety during the tram ride. At the time, I was attributing it to being a little paranoid on pot, so I wasn't concerned - until I started to lose my vision.",1
"7) what if there arent enough houses for all the people in this world? ( yes..seriously)  we have never lost him, he has never been stung by a bee, we do not have the news on around him, nor has our house been broken into.However, he has heard grown ups out in public talking about the recent school shooting. He also gets night terrors and nightmares and is afraid to fall asleep sometimes.  how do I help him manage his anxiety in an age appropriate way?",1
"Iâ€™m currently doing EMDR for my severe anxiety issues and depression. Weâ€™re going through past instances that have plagued me and are why my mindset is a negative shithole. I had my anxiety in a certain place, where I felt comfortable. The anxiety was there but I managed it well enough. Things were not perfect and there was still a lot of things that needed to change in order for me to progress.",1
"I am 25 years old and recently had to stay with my mother and her new husband. My mom has had issues on and off throughout my childhood, but it is only recently that I identified her as a narcissist. We used to be very close (inappropriately so), but last week she disowned me and asked me to move out over a Reddit post she found of mine (not this account). I am moving out on Sunday, and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.",1
"Certain things will make me feel uncomfortable. as of recently she will jokingly play with my nipples, like suck on them or biting them if we are laying in bed and Iâ€™m shirtless. This makes very uncomfortable and I donâ€™t like it at all. Iâ€™ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I donâ€™t like the feeling of it. She will keep jokingly doing so and tell me stop being a baby or that she is just joking around.",1
"But in that moment neither my words nor my body made a difference...he did what he wanted.... I wanted to push him, kick him, shout...but...i couldnt move. There were times he didn't listen to me but I never thought it would lead to him forcing himself onto me. I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.",1
"I was trying to eat my food but my hands became shaky and i then didnt feel hungry. People kept asking me why my hands are shaky, and the people across from me laughing at me. Idk what to do, ive worked here for 3 years but i just cant get over my anxiety. I just hate having meetings and celebrating with co workers. I havent been diagnose for anxiety disorder but i want to been on medication?",1
"Anytime I have a scheduled transaction towards my checking account, my wages are immediately garnished. However, last night was the real wake up call. After work, I came home drunk and let my stress get the best of me. I ended up getting in a fight with my gf about money, finances and utilities. Not wanting to face the pathetic reality that I have ""sugar momma"" for a girlfriend, I packed everything I own in my vehicle, parked it less than a mile away (incase I may have forgotten anything) and slept in it until the battery died.",1
"Kinda interesting how even when Iâ€™m not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if itâ€™s the biological sleepiness or if itâ€™s kinda a pavlovian response because Iâ€™m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway, how are you all doing?",1
"Hi, I am 21 years old, I used to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety last year, but somehow managed to beat it and live like a normal person again. But from time to time, i have this weird feeling that I am gonna pass out or something like that, my face is pale and I feel this uncomfortable pressure in my eye balls, it happens when I'm at university during class or even during normal daily activities. I did some blood tests and everything is fine, so is this anxiety again?",1
"Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....",1
"I see him in person 1 - 3 times per week, almost always at restaurants. If it matters, we've never been to each others apartment. It is in his lease that he can't have guests over (???). I've invited him to mine but it hasn't worked out. I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me, so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.",1
"When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac. 3 years later, I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks. That actually seemed to work well and I've been off the prozac for about a year and even got off Facebook 3 months ago because it was becoming a point of unneeded drama, but I'm suddenly getting the depression symptoms again. I've walled myself off from most people and have become less communicative with my husband. I don't like going to our neighbors house because I have a paranoia that 2 of them don't like me.",1
"I was cleaning my house with bleach, got a nasty burn in my throat when I woke up the next day. Day later it went away, but the day after that I got the worst body aches, chills, 100.6 fever, and dizziness for 2 days. It all cleared up but I have had this dry cough for 4 days now with no relief, it keeps me up at night, and I go into these coughing fits. What should I Do? I can't see a doctor for 2 more weeks as I am out of town on a job, i think I am a hypocongiract so ii worry a lot lol.",1
"I have almost constant health anxiety. It's a mixture of agoraphobia and health anxiety. I'm afraid of having some incurable disease or suddenly stopping breathing... I've been kinda iffy the past few days, just tired from lack of sleep, and I usually feel like shit after my period which triggers my anxiety. Well anyway I went out to meet my mom for some food and the first thing she says to me is ""wow are you okay?""",1
"I spent six years in a very abusive relationship. We had a child together. After she was born, I made my way out. I ended up fleeing several houses and apartments trying to stay away from him. Thereâ€™s been a long history.",1
Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success. Because the carpet is cover in pee from animals and reminds me of my mothers house. How i used to go to school every morning covered in cat and dog urine. Every little bit of confrontation feels like world war 3 in my head. Every little feels like it gets put on me as blame and i cant deal.,1
"Do I live in this cycle forever? Is there really no chance for me? I can't even begin to explain how my sibling got out, it was pure luck and they are heavily dependent on an S/O. I feel like I'm grabbing at straws. I've done this song and dance a million times.",1
"I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him. He was too big for them to punish. So I endured it , some days I hate my whole family for never saying anything. They just were okay with me being scared of my brother constantly. Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.",1
"I haven't posted here yet, but as everyone here has probably experienced, PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school, I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason, dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.",1
He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done. He kept packing. So I called the police. I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option. The police department chose not to press charges.,1
I need help. I need sound advice on how I can overcome this situation. I need brutal honesty. Merci ! Please excuse my grammatical errors,1
Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.,1
"I can't get over this feeling. Nothing feels good. I just finished spring break and I had a chance to work out every day. Even when I was working out, I felt overwhelmingly anxious. I can't state concisely what I'm thinking.",1
"I've never done this before but we always stay at my house, so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit. She said my eyes were open and I don't know if she believes it was accidental... How can I manage this situation? That's all I really need to know, I don't know what to do.",1
"If they weren't done he would get angry at her. After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money. Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted. The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later."" While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.",1
"She says she's sorry and that she would never have taken it to a physical place, and completely rejected the first co-workers request to take it further. However she continued to talk to him and also continued to talk and flirt with the second co-worker, when she knew he had romantic feelings. She says she's sorry and has an addiction to being desired. I told her it's not fair to me or the men she's leading on. She agrees and is trying to convince me to stay with her.",1
I don't know if I should call it abuse. FiancÃ© suffers from PTSD & alcoholism... Punched me and threw shit at me at an international airport and almost got himself kicked off the flight. Last night was the 2nd time but far worse. He beat me with a bag he thought I packed and thought I was going to leave him (it was a bag I forgot to unpack and was in the closet). My head was bleeding profusely and I (thank goodness) ran outside and called for help...,1
"It's like Everyone else is allowed to be frustrated but me. So I use a lot of my UPT (unpaid time off; it's the ONLY time off we get, no vacation or anything) for my sister - her wedding (a whole fucking week), her kids' birthdays that she insists I be at, and things like their baptisms. And I know I use a lot of my hours on them, but overlook it because I love them and know they want to see me. But I only have 6 hours left, and each shift is 4 hours. I might have to use 4 of those today because the front of my house is flooded (there's a car stuck there and an officer blocking off people from entering), because I emailed HR and even sent in a picture but this company just doesn't give a fuck and probably won't cancel.",1
He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him. He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise. I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still wonâ€™t want to leave him. The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him. And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,1
"""I understand as a woman why you are doing this. But as a mother, I am begging you not to press charges. It will ruin his life. Please, let us take care of him. We'll set him straight.",1
Iâ€™m coming to find that my family are rapist sympathizers given the â€œrightâ€ circumstance (ie. sports). How would you want the media to change? What would make it easier to watch the news while also covering newsworthy topics? My head is in a fog still so hopefully that all made sense.,1
"This is marriage #2 for both of us. Husband's (52 M) ex (51 F) cheated, my ex (53 M) had emotional affair, leading to ending marriages in the same year. We dated in high school, and reconnected as friends, started dating about a year later, moved in together after a year, got engaged 2 years after that. Before getting engaged I found out he was having an emotional affair with a woman who lived about a 5 hour drive away from us. I found out when he left an IM open on his computer, found steamy texts when I went to shut off a noisy program.",1
Iâ€™m just wondering how many of you have A LOT of triggers? I was abused extremely horribly as a teenager and into adulthood and I have horrible ptsd from it. I literally get triggered by everything and anything. Like someone could sneeze and it would sound similar to him and Iâ€™d freak. I freak out horribly about everything and the littlest things.,1
- kicked me out of the house and was going to make me leave in the middle of the night multiple times while insulting me and hitting me I'm sorry to even post this here but I need a little support right now. He said this to me two nights ago and came into our guest bedroom where I was sleeping the next day and said sorry Kind of. I tried to talk to him about it and he said he was under a lot of stress and that he doesn't need my love or support and he doesn't want to talk about it. Super sorry for the fucked up formatting but y'all get the idea...,1
"It was a conversation about those things. Over and over. Her name, which normally it isn't a trigger, but since I've been in a fragile state lately, I was just getting dragged down on the inside. I'm so tired. I just wanted to ask them to stop saying it.",1
"I'm in my third year at uni and starting my diss now (its due in January), and I'm really struggling with feelings of dread and anxiety.

"I need to know what to do. A psychopathic family member was promised MY house, for some strange fucking reason, for apparently a very long time now. I have an abusive ex, that wonâ€™t leave me alone and his parents say escape and live with them, but he most likely will follow me where I go. He told me he would. Should I get a restraining order before I go?",1
"My ex sent me a video of a switchblade, I asked him why he had that and he said â€œcutting people upâ€ and then he said â€œitâ€™s an Italian style switch bladeâ€.. Iâ€™m Italian... Anyways, heâ€™s put a loaded gun to my head in the past. Iâ€™m actually pretty terrified of him now. He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he â€œforgot they were thereâ€.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him. Which is why I canâ€™t talk to anyone.",1

"He broke contact with the whole family, only sparingly speaking to his little sister after she followed his example and split. I think he is very ashamed of his past. He *never* talked about anything like this with me. Iâ€™m honestly really worried he thinks I would think less of him if I knew, and the idea of that breaks my heart. I didnâ€™t tell him what his sister told me.",1

Iâ€™m counting down the days until tax season so we can fill up the pantry! We receive about $700 each year from the Wisconsin Homestead Tax Credit which is what we use to catch up on bills, prescriptions, and to stock up on food. Itâ€™s extremely heart wrenching when my own mother or grandchildren cannot have a bowl of cereal because thereâ€™s no milk and guess what, no cereal.",1
"Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days. I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them. The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets. While I was waiting to use the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to). She then came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed, pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of some sedative.",1
"I have a very hard time with trying to find a job, from most places I don't get any feedbacks, but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower, while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences, political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason, etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects), my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik), not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part, but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit, such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry, which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles, game consoles, phones, etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic, because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist). My father is seriously thinking on kicking me out to the streets if I won't pay, which makes me to go back to my mother, and my abusive stepfather who cannot accept my autistic quirks, implying if I can go back to them and my stepfather will let it all go through.",1
"Grad school isnâ€™t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships donâ€™t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you canâ€™t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.",1
When I take the time to relax and think of something nice like a waterfall or a forest or something like that I then automatically think of how bad people are going to mess it up and pollute and make it worse and just be awful. It makes it hard for me to relax. I try to think of something tranquil and then thoughts like these pop into my head. Meditation isn't that nice for me. My mind just races.,1
"It feels as if no one understands what Iâ€™m going through in my life because I took a while to leave and didnâ€™t tell anyone until now. I really didnâ€™t think it was that bad. Now that Iâ€™m out of the situation, it still haunts me. I feel guilty and still like itâ€™s all my fault somehow even though itâ€™s irrational and not true. Does anyone else feel like this?",1
"I walk up to the door, unlock it and open it. It's K. With my boyfriend standing by in sight I ask him what he's doing here. He says nothing but stares at me with this blank stare. Then I get this weird gut feeling and ask ""have you been drinking?"" In which he shakes his head.",1

Iâ€™m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and Iâ€™m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling? But Iâ€™m afraid if I do Iâ€™m going to have to talk more about what happened and Iâ€™m going to break. Iâ€™ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and canâ€™t remember anything.

I'm concerned because she found out last night that he is seeing this ex gf of his. He doesn't know how she found out - he's kept it very, very private. She came back to the house they used to share (he was there with their kids in bed while she had been out) and lost it with him.",1

However, I need to finance med but I need to work on my current stature to get the money but this job makes me anxious to the point that I am having refluxes because of stress just the thought of working on it.

So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1

Can anyone relate to this feeling? I canâ€™t enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. Iâ€™m not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance. When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out. Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.,1
A few years ago I witnessed an accident at this time of year and I am beginning to remember it again. At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying. I didnâ€™t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but Iâ€™m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1

Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.

"I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but Iâ€™m still worried because I donâ€™t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries.

"I had bought our son a special outfit themed from the movies just for this occassion. Neither of us got much sleep that night, and when I tried to talk to him in the morning about leaving, he got really agitated and raised his voice to me. Our daughter ran into her room and I found her hiding under her covers. After again trying to talk to him, he ended up refusing to go, I'm still not sure why. He then ignored me for days again, we again briefly made up for my son's birthday, and started fighting again not long after.",1
I need to make a decision now. My whole course of life is depending on the wisdom of redditors. share with me your thoughts so that i may add to my own. please help. Thanks for your time.,1
"So I've basically got a plan: hoard all my drugs until Tuesday, OD that night with a combo of slit wrists and maybe even hanging. I want it to be damn efficient, because this is trial number 13. These are the thoughts I've been having lately. My last attempt was at a hospital, just a few days ago, but I lied and told them it was my anxiety that led me to self-harm. They discharged me.",1
I never thought Iâ€™d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that wonâ€™t stop. I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesnâ€™t stop. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s just because it was less than 24 hours ago and Iâ€™m still just in shock? Itâ€™s just a lot to take in right now  and Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I apologize for any formatting issues because Iâ€™m on mobile/ sounding incoherent Iâ€™m just kind of numb after all this and unsure what to do.,1

"Ugh. I just need to tell people who I know will understand what happened. If you can relate, offer support, anything... that would be appreciated.

"I used to take sleeping pills that had a bit of anti anxiety medicine in them but my pcp drug tested me and because I had been found to have been smoking weed , ( for my ptsd ), it was either stop coming their for the sleeping pills or weed. I chose weed mostly because I was pissed they drug tested me for one but also weed seems to do the best for me. Now im regretting that decision. I guess I need a new pcp huh? Anyway its a reddit until I dont feel like a deer in headlights  kind of night so whoopee.",1
Every time I tell him to leave he threatens to harm my pets or take them and release them to the wild (I have ferrets.... they CANNOT survive in the wild where I live) or he goes into rants about how useless I am and how I couldn't survive without him and somehow he worms his way back in for fear he might be right. TLDR; need him out. He threatens animals. **REALLY** don't wanna involve police. What do I do?,1
"My mom has always been a pushover and is known to give him money with no questions asked. Last night, my brother sent a group message to me and my sisters telling us to not tell our parents anything he is saying and that he loves us very much. He says he started selling drugs recently to make more money and some of his supply was stolen and now he's afraid his ""friend""/dealer will come after him. I offered to let him spend the night at my house if he felt unsafe, but he declined my offer and said that he'll take care of it. I tried to reassure myself that no dealer will kill someone over a missing gram of pot (he was advertising on snapchat) and I went to bed hoping that he would just get roughed up if anything.",1
"I had to do some other repairs (thanks potholes!) that put me even further behind on payments. I can do the brakes myself to save money. I have a friend with jacks and tools. I just really need help getting the brakes, I'm actually getting worried about them now, starting to get spongy.",1
"Kinda. But now itâ€™s just weird. He buys us matching clothes, tries to get us to do the same shit, constantly insists that weâ€™re so similar, etc. They try to hold my hands when we go out, and when I told my dad I needed her to stop being so touchy with me, he guilt tripped the fuck out of me. Iâ€™m 19 in a few days, I need to get out of here, but I feel so fucking guilty.",1
Im positive the 2 panic attacks and the following brain fog is anxiety based because like i said I've had mild anxiety in the past and i don't think i have any other issues. Anyways i was wondering if its normal to feel spaced out and a little slow/ tired a few days panic attacks. I haven't touched weed since but i still feel spaced out. Any insight would be appreciated. I also noticed when i don't focus on my worry i feel a little better,1
"It makes me so disappointed in myself because I hate what I've become and I hate feeling so helpless. I'm to the point where I'm afraid, not knowing why. Most days I end up crying at work.

There's even an awkwardness with my manager who only talks to me to criticise and complain, and just before my holiday she gave me an informal warning.",1

Have any of you gone through something similar, and have any advice? I appreciate it.",1
"In some ways, I can handle it more than the average person who hasn't gone though such a trauma. Sometimes it's hard to remember that, though, when you're breaking down over some otherwise harmless feedback. I'm tired of people misunderstanding. I'm tired of feeling weak and broken. I'm just tired.",1
"Now that I'm approaching middle age, I want to tell myself that they're just busy and don't have time to reply. But how long does it take to write a short email or make a brief phone call? Something specific *must* have happened to get them all to turn it off at once. For the life of me, I can't think of what it might have been. And that's what bothers me.",1
"Not because I didnâ€™t have evidence, but because none of the evidence was permissible in court. My last order of protection was denied. Iâ€™m a survivor of childhood incest.

"The following week, my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one, so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with, he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable, so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.",1
"Kyle got out and started contacting me again, writing letters to â€œprove he still knew where I livedâ€, and â€œbeing able to get in touch with me regardless of me blocking himâ€. I have some friends in the police force near me, who I informed of the situation. About the same time I started talking to them, Kyle was put in jail for separate reasons. Since these two events, he has stopped contacting me (thank Christ.) James knows about Kyle, but I havenâ€™t told James about the most recent developments because he has had a lot going on (a death in the family, health issues, among others).",1
"I have trouble connecting to it on a personal level, but isn't that healthy separation of past/present? I think my present anxieties/self image issues stem from traumatic experiences, but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed. I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore? I realized most my recent ""panic attacks"" may be ""breakdowns"" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control... I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.",1
"I wanted to go to this art school in an expensive city only because this place is wayyyyyyy cheaper then most art schools and it has all the majors I'm interested in, which I could use for like storyboards for movies and what not. They have really nice dorms and if I could just get the funding for school I could do that, but I have really bad mental illness and I need my cat, he checks to make sure I'm breathing at night and comforts me during panic attacks. Which means I'd need an apartment, and a job. I'm not against working my ass off, I'm just getting down right now, no responses to applications can do that. I'm in a state that doesn't even have a real art school.",1
"For the last week, my car has been acting up. Yes, it's 16 years old but the only other person to have the car before I did was my 85 year old grandmother who only drove it to either the grocery store or the thrift store, so I got it almost brand new. But lately everything g has been going wrong. The gas gage doesn't work, the dash lights don't work, my tires need to be filled at least once every day, the brakes go out often, my battery won't start if it gets too cold, and now the transmission is starting to have issues. Without a job, I don't have money to pay to fix everything.",1
"It was no longer just about the life and love we were building together. It was no longer about us, it was about me and trying to fill this hole within myself.

I see you and Jane are out tonight so as I sit here alone and dying inside knowing that the most important thing in my life is leaving me and Iâ€™ll never even see you again, doesnâ€™t something inside you feel just a morsel of empathy and reciprocal love back for me and to me and want to give me some chance? Why do I have to be destroyed for this?",1
"For me, that doesn't HELP AT ALL. It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off, and my problem has suddenly become his, minimizing my emotions about it? (I hope that makes sense). He always says I need to be protected, but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore, but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will. I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.",1

I'm wondering if anyone else deals with a lot of nausea from their anxiety and what they do to cope with it? I'm terrified of throwing up and so this is like the worst symptom I could ever have.... plus I always have this weird feeling in my chest/throat like something is coming up or is stuck and am belching a lot, like tiny burps. I feel like I'm crumbling and am starting to really slow down...

"i never really knew people gave a shit about me, and it really meant a lot to me; it still does. but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them? why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull? why am i crying right now? i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.",1
"Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope? Speaking to my therapist I'm realizing that my method of coping with the intense anxiety I've faced in life was to become so organized that I thought I could control everything. But when situations arise, especially with those I'm in a relationship with where I can't control the situation, my anxiety goes out of control so I end up lashing out in negative ways. If you have found you were controlling and were able to better yourself can you please direct me on where to turn to do the same?",1
"No, not really. I thanked my boyfriend, and then immediately blurted out ""how am I going to explain this to my mother?"" Like I said, he's understanding, but I could see him kinda wince as he probably realized that the gifts brought me more anxiety than happiness. **I spent the next half hour desperately thinking up backstories I could use to explain to my mother why I had a brand new hat. **",1

Multiple things keep the DDLG from relationship from being public and I hate sneaking around. I want to have an open relationship with the other girl.",1
I havenâ€™t really complained. Only once when my gram asked me to do a million and one things in a span of a few minutes (go get this go do that) when i was already trying to setup my moms new iPad so she could watch Netflix in the hospital. That all said and done and I feel like shit. Idk if itâ€™s sick but it also feels a hellavua Lot like anxiety. So i get my mom whoâ€™s in the apartment next door to ask her to lay with me for a few minutes.,1

I posted about a month ago and felt pretty defeated (but very grateful to receive anything at all because one very generous gentleman gave me $100) but I am back to the end of the month with a phone bill due tomorrow and dwindling food and gas and rent approaching soon. Iâ€™m 25f and 4 months in recovery. Iâ€™m working part time to focus on recovery but trying to find a second job so I can stop finding myself in money binds. I have no friends and family to ask for money and have made literally $550 since July working for Bath and Body Works and $200 with DoorDash since August. My rent is $600 and phone bill is $55 and car insurance is $100 which I havenâ€™t even paid this month.,1
"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it. Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened. He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.",1
"I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"". She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person. but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely. Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.",1
"I got a very bad feeling but I at first ignored it. The babysitter was a man and someone I had never met! I was scared because I didn't know this man and I didn't understand why her Mother thought it was alright for a man to babysit 2 girls, one of them being a child he never had contact with. Her Mom proceeds to leave the house and we're there with this strange and creepy man. I was completely uncomfortable the entire time.",1

It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help.

"Itâ€™s becoming cyclical for me, where I â€œretreatâ€ and revise and then feel like I need to retrigger myself to avoid slipping back into denial that it happened the way it happened. I canâ€™t live like this. I donâ€™t want to live a lie but sometimes the lie is what keeps me functioning. My therapist is away for a month and this means I have no one to push me to deal with this thing. I donâ€™t know what to do.",1
"She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this, should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?",1

Don't even have a phone currently (this one will change soon). Can't get any assistance because I have no residency. I feel forever fucked in this spiral of shit that I myself have created but can't seem to flush.",1
"Itâ€™s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments theyâ€™ve made in the past. I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened. So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did. Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that. Trauma shouldnâ€™t be a competition.",1
And we are almost out of groceries until food stamps come in on the 3rd. I don't know what to do without him but I'm covered in bruises and in so much pain.

"I beg him to let go of me so I can get my phone and call my dad. I bang on the floor and scream for help to try to get the downstairs neighbours' attention. He mocks my crying and tells me he's not doing anything to me, that I'm freaking out over nothing. We're struggling against each other, his elbow hitting my face, his arm occasionally choking me. I fight hard to inch towards my phone to get help, but any time I get close he grabs my phone and throw it out of my reach.",1

The emergency funds I had are now gone as my apartment recently got broken into. I have no family and am truly at a loss here in las vegas.

The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else).

And yet despite all these blessings I've been paralysed for the last week, unable to function at work. By a lie.",1
"I'm male and i live with my partner of 4 years. We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child. Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town). I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of. The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.",1
"Even though we did break up I don't know if he's taking it seriously and if he just thinks I'll come home and we'll be ok. I'm so tired of being treated like shit by everyone in my life. I'm not strong enough to take care of myself, to fight back, to leave. And I can't work, I can't even answer phone calls because of my anxiety, how am I supposed to survive? My family doesn't understand my mental issues so I can't get help from them with it, they tell me I need to start looking for a job and I can't even say anything.",1
" I feel like I have no personality or sense of self, and my mind will take sudden turns every week or so. I can get sudden obsessions for things and then drop them and lose interest instantly, because my whole set of core values, ideas and principles changes constantly. And I've seen people saying that it's normal. I highly doubt it's normal to change so drastically and so quickly, because I have to accommodate to a new personality every single week, and it's disturbing. Actually, there were times when I changed from one day to the other and it's so disturbing because I didn't know what was happening to me...I just woke up feeling and being completely different, like something changed everything about me overnight.",1
"I saw a shadow figure standing in my bedroom door... so I'm camped out in my mom's room. I have bipolar I as well, so it's likely that's the cause of the hallucinations. &#x200B; I can't take this. I've had several anxiety attacks in the last few weeks; twice, I was sent home from work about half an hour early.",1
"I have been always told that I was a burden, a waste of space and that I was a fuck up even tho I'm the only one in my family 2 get any qualifications nevermind getting into uni. I'll most likely end up homeless as I can't even work as I have little work experience and I try part time jobs just 2 end up having a panic attack early on which got me fired each time. My friends are all at uni doing well 2 which makes me feel worse while I'm at home being a sack of shit who stays indoors all day with no social interaction other than my parents berating me about life. I don't even know what 2 do and it's killing me. My friends constantly remark about me being a mess.",1
"I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her. So I'm writing this in the parking lot of my college afraid to go home. Awesome",1
"Already borrowed what I can from family and friends, living on my own, and rather exhausted that. I'd rather not share my specific adress in public, so PM if you want to help. Got no preferences, but a kebab or pizza with varied stuff in it would be great for nutrition. Hate asking for this, but I'm at a low point and getting rather desperate. If ordering isn't the thing for you, a small amount of money to buy something cheap at the store is just as good.",1
"Every minor detail feels just so overwhelming that I feel suffocated and panicky all the time. I imagine others here have gone through something similar, so I wanted to ask about your experience with grad school applications. How did you survive? How did you preserve your mental health, and do the best that you could? Thanks so much.",1
"I simply stayed home and did nothing, I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world. I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it. Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society). Then I started reading more books to improve myself, and that was when I started to earn some savings. I returned to school and the first semester back I managed to get As in half of my courses.",1
"Why did I have to scream in pain? Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me]. I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side. Once, the wood splintered and went into my back. Still no-one stopped him.",1
I have had two or three or more reoccurring dreams of me cheating on my boyfriend.. and they are so real that I actually feel awful when I wake up or like it actually happened. I've been spooked when I've woken up because it's actually felt like he left and it happened.. can someone shed some light on what this means? my boyfriend is 18 and I am 19 I am female he is male. we have been in a relationship for around 6/7 months. Recently me and my boyfriend had been going through a tough stage and I've been carrying a huge amount of guilt and I've been feeling like I'm not a good person at all...,1
"While my friends and myself included, have high hopes that this will work out, Iâ€™m petrified because I am putting my feelings on the table. Iâ€™m going to be so damn vulnerable. While heâ€™s expressed and shown signs that heâ€™s just as into this as I am, if not more so, Iâ€™ve also never done this before. Iâ€™ve only been in 1 (college) relationship before this, followed by 3 years of singleness and ultimate casual fuckery. I know my feelings for him are real and I owe it to myself to fight for a chance of a relationship with someone I feel so strongly for.",1
"Thatâ€™s it for me. Bye, world. I run and hide inside a key repairs store. The shop attendant give me a worried look. I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
Do I force myself to move forward? Am I being ridiculous because I still have ptsd? I feel like theyâ€™re so out of line. Iâ€™m all over the place. Just someone please help.,1
"&#x200B; Hey everyone, Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago, my  personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my  maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay  with my family in Wilson, having to have family members be rescued from  their home due to a severe flash flood, and dealing with the shock and  emotions of loss once returning. On top of that, two of my family  members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of  recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major  impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with  insurance adjusters and etc.",1
As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I donâ€™t tell people why Iâ€™m in this situation because it scares people. Itâ€™s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have fâ€™d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,1
"When we returned we discovered that one of our beloved pets' health had taken a turn for the worse and we had to them euthanized, so that was a setback. We still have not been able to pay rent for May. Our landlords are trying to work with us but I believe they are becoming impatient, also since the 5th there is an additional $5 owed for every day that it is late so the amount is growing. We are also still very behind in our utility bills. I was able to negotiate something with the company that I finance my car through so that it would be easier to make the payments but could still use some help paying my insurance this month before it is cancelled again (It was cancelled briefly in April but I was able to get it reinstated).",1
"Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house. Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own. I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here. I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything. Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.",1
"Cigarettes used to help but they don't anymore. Alcohol helps, but then it comes back worse the next day. In the months that it's not happening, I'm well-adjusted. I thrive. But then my luck changes, someone starts listening to music next door or revving an old engine in their yard, and all my progress collapses.",1
"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this. Lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone. We involved CPS, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him. After their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.",1
"I'm just really scared in general of not living up to expectations my partner may have. A lot of my life is built on trying to be exciting, fun, or entertaining, I'm just scared I won't be able to keep it up for my partner. The last thing I want them is to describe their boyfriend (me) as bland or boring, but I feel like that's how I'll make them feel, and it'll just lead to heartache. So, I've come to the most recent conclusion (after seeing my two best friends get girlfriends and me being the awkward loser who can't get one). That maybe I'm not the type of person who's built for relationships.",1
"I was at work today and this guy I just met was just exuding this layer of confidence, he was; to an extent everything I wanted to be when it came to my relationships with others. There was no reason to hate him, but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him. He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that. Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done, but like, I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off, because of this envy. I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.",1
"We were doing so good.â€ Iâ€™m feel as if I canâ€™t be angry at any of his actions, and my words mean nothing,  and my threats are empty. He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him, he treats me as if I owe him sex. Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly, about how we havenâ€™t and itâ€™s just â€œmakes him feel so bad and self conscious about himselfâ€ I donâ€™t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.",1
"That was nice. But now that we're close to the point of no return, with a flight booked so he can come see her(I agreed to travel out of our house for the week), and they seem to be bonding big time(I love you's abound), I'm not sure what to do with myself. On one hand I want to let loose and detach, let her have fun, and do so myself. If it leads to a new LTR for her, awesome. But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.",1
And I really don't know what to do. This isn't nearly the first time he lied and there have also been other things (like him being unemployed for 6 months and not looking for a job while his parents pay foe everything and he lives with me). But I get that life can be hard and it sometimes can get you down. But I just feel like my trust is broken over and over and over again. And I don't know what to do.,1
I was venting how pissed off she made me to one of my friends. I didn't know [3M] was listening to our conversation. He asked me and my friend what a period was. My friend took him to his mother who was in the kitchen. She just told us to keep an eye on him while she did some things.,1
"For example, I'm selling something that's worth Â£50? You can have it for Â£10. I hate it, I want to cry. I've had items listed for about 2 weeks, they're all responsibly priced or under and I'm having to accept low ball offers as I have no other choice. I would never let myself in a million years do this if I wasn't homeless but the clock is ticking and I need to move.",1
"It's not really safe for me to be driving. I can't even function enough to do the grocery shopping. Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work). Is this something a service dog would be helpful for?",1
"This is so hard to write about for me. Attempting to describe what I've been through cuts me really deep down and spins me through flashes of pain, tears, and the deepest depression. I really feel kicked when I'm already down. So please, forgive me for the winded intro and shaking writing style. It has honestly taken me a week just to get to this point.",1
"I feel alone, because I feel like people don't think ""I was having a panic attack"" as a legitimate excuse to miss something. I don't even feel like others with panic attacks 100% get it, because I don't really get that feeling of a heart attack or anything, I feel like my panic attacks are weird, and all the stuff I read about ways to help seem to be for people who get the heart attack feelings. I get a panic attack, and then get anxious about the panic attack, and it's just a big cycle. I try to open up to people, but they don't really understand. I just want to be normal.",1
"I am afraid of anything and everything at the same time I am afraid of what happened or what may happen. I am afraid the world, the earth, the skies, the stars, aliens, humans, animals, whatever fucking bullshit thought that had occurred in my head that makes my skin crawl. I am afraid of what I am or what I might become. I am afraid that I might go crazy or fight that I might become boring, or normal, or average, or weird, or some fucking hippie, or some fucking stupid hard-headed person.",1
"Before it happened I had been good friends with him and I admired him a lot as a child. I don't want to ruin his life, and whenever I meet him I act normal and happy. When I talk about him I smile and act normal. Sometimes I feel like I can forgive him for what happened, but sometimes I have nightmares and I feel dirty. I think of what happened a lot.",1
"I just got a new job and I won't get paid until the 18th. I've only been unemployed for a week now, the company I worked for closed and after bills I have no money. I was already trying to get on my feet from being let go from my long-term job in October. If you could help me I will contribute to this sub when I can, pay you back, reciprocate in any way that I can. I don't have family that I can ask for help (both parents are deceased, no siblings, not close with Aunts and Uncles).",1
I also want to set the record straight with my family. What should I do? Tldr : I dislike my mom for legitimate reasons. She's telling my family it's because my head is all messed up from my mental illness. It's gotten back to me and is making me angry and making me feel victimized and weird about myself all over again.,1
"I legitimately do not know anyone who has survived this, and I feel like i'm not even human any more. As I type this, i'm sobbing, because it's all just so FUCKING truly disheartening. I used to be a person. I feel like a ghost now. Are there any steps I can take at all whatsoever to start my turn back into normalcy, or am I trapped inside of this until I either die or claw my way out of whatever hole i've fallen into?",1
"I take solo back packing trips and my friends really see me as someone fearless and free-spirited. It makes opening up about my mental health issues kinda difficult because they can't ""see"" me acting this way. I have a lot of anxiety and depression issues around my romantic relationships. I also have depersonalization issues, and want to be alone more often then not. I think the fact that I can be so outgoing and positive most of the time, my friends don't realize that I struggle quite a bit some days.",1
"So, I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid. I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it. I really like her and trust her, but the guided questions she asks remind me of how few specific details I actually remember. Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it. It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?",1
"Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but itâ€™s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day. My home life wasnâ€™t super bad but school was a living hell. I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting. Sorry for the rant, itâ€™s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school. Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.",1
"She has a history of being extremely over the top, and in our most recent argument she verbally abused me just for because I was upset that she broke my trust by telling my personal details to someone I didn't know. She did apologize a good day later, but only very vaguely about using cuss words and in a ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" kind of sense. I'm guessing a traditional ""we need to talk, it's just not working out"" approach would just end up with her blowing up again, and since all my past relationships ended very amicably I'm not sure what to expect. Because she can be incredibly toxic, I've considered just blocking her and essentially ""ghosting,"" but I also feel like that would be very rude and she'd at least deserve an explanation. How do I break up with her without having her potentially flipping out at me?",1
? What if I am at a friends party and a man whispers in my ear that he likes to stare at me so he can touch himself later....but he is dating my friend and he knows I donâ€™t want to upset her?? ? What if I am in the car with a man and some lady cuts him off and he gets road rage and says he wants to â€œdrag her out of the car by her hair and cut her nipples offâ€ but then later says he â€œobviously didnâ€™t mean itâ€?? ?,1
"It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....) I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works? Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5?",1
Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to â€œprotectâ€ me. He wonâ€™t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I donâ€™t answer (I donâ€™t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying). I understand that the events were traumatic for Tom. I recognize that every time I go to a follow up medical appointment he is frightened. I understand that the fact that I still take medication scares him.,1
"And Iâ€™ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I canâ€™t breathe Iâ€™m shaking Iâ€™m numb. And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isnâ€™t happening right now. This is your past, this isnâ€™t our present. Iâ€™ve never lied to you. Iâ€™ve always kept my promises to you.",1
I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,1
"Unfortunately, it also affects pretty much everything in my life, including working memory and everyday events. It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown. I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory, I can go back to get more solid treatment options? If so, who should I see for help?",1
"No, that's not an exaggeration but I wish I was. While I was driving last Tuesday I got extremely lightheaded, sweaty, and then pulled over and vomited blood all over the interior of my car. After a few moments of wonder if 'this was it' and deciding 'it definitely wasn't it, not on a highway' I snapped by myself back to what life was left and drove to the next exit to find help. My SO has a great summary of why this ended up costing so much money, but it's a sequence of very unfortunate events. That's even before the fact that while I was intubated and unconscious someone lifted the bag of all my clothes wallet.",1
"I've never even told anyone this because it makes me feel like a 32-year-old loser. But now I have no pride to lose by saying it, so there it is. **I don't want to die, but the thought of living in a place I hate and having no control of my future is a worse fate. **  I just need some HOPE. Thanks for listening.",1
"She is in need of some house repairs and a reliable car. Her fixed income and family support isn't enough to get everything done. The van sheâ€™s driving has some serious problems. The transmission is dying and there's no heater or defroster. The lights, blinkers, and brakes don't always work right due to electrical problems.",1
"However, this was 5 months ago and I have heard nothing about the referral. Things are going downhill (not with my eating, which is good! ), but my PTSD symptoms are loud. I'm not sleeping, my self harm has escalated and I'm struggling to leave my house. I'm also just about to lose my job because the company I work for is going under.",1
"yesterday, I almost had sex with someone. but when it was happening, I felt only halfway there. and now my memory of it is hazy, and when I try to think about it I don't see it from my perspective, I see it from like above me. like it wasn't *actually*happening to me. I genuinely enjoy having sex, but I would like to know ways to lessen my trauma symptoms and stay present during it.",1
Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back. If I do I will occasionally see places and buildings connected to bad memories. When visiting my town now I am OK seeing those places but I don't like it so I avoid them. My choices are moving back or sell and start a new life elsewhere. So I ask if anyone else have done a similar move back to your hometown and managed well?,1
So my roommate recently moved out and our apartment is pretty empty and ever since she moved out iâ€™ve had the worst anxiety attacks and have been kinda depending on my boyfriend and spending time with him to distract me but he works night and thatâ€™s when my anxiety is the absolute WORST. everything flutters through my head. like i think iâ€™m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me?? (heâ€™s never expressed this. heâ€™s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like iâ€™m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because iâ€™m alone and i feel useless like no one care???,1
"Disability allowance doesn't seem like it would be enough to cover even just my rent, never mind food (for me and my pets) and lighting and heating. I can't take my cat and my dog into a shelter. I don't know what to do. I feel like I just have to come to terms with how he is and learn to live with it but I'm miserable all the time. I don't have any friends anymore.",1
"Hi Im a 19 year old kid dealing with Agoraphobia over the past year. Very boldly said, Agoraphobia is the fear of going to public places, sometimes to even leave the house. The past week, some very unpleasant things have happened in my household. I told my parents about what I've been dealing with a while back.",1
"There's nothing I can say or do that will alleviate her worries. In the past I've tried to solve things but that doesn't help. I've tried just listening and agreeing or offering comments like ""that does sound bad"" or ""I understand"" but those don't seem to help either. Does anyone have advice on what I can do or say to not cause anger or start a fight? I'm at a loss as to what I need to do or be for her.",1
" I just stop doing productive things, talking to people, remembering appointments,  etc. I am unemployed and almost broke but looking for work is causing me to feel like I can't swallow or get a full breath. I find that I have played video games all day, surfed Reddit or this morning I read reviews on a book that is coming out for almost 2 hours. I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway. To make it even more fun, my sister is mad at me because I am ""chronically self centered"" because I forgot to get back to her about possibly getting together for dinner, because I am shut down.",1
"But I was feeling more and more lonely... like I couldn't trust or rely on her. It was tearing me to pieces and I was always anxious. Finally, after a breakdown I had on christmas over my fears and the lack of help from my partner in healing from this, she broke up with me. I went home the next day and we haven't spoken since. I've been devastated.",1
"The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake. This happens for hours. I forget the scientific name for this, but it doesn't really matter. I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping. Like fucking why?",1
Wtf. I did this to myself. I knew I needed to study and I just kept putting it off and putting it off. I knew I didnâ€™t do well but I didnâ€™t think I bombed it so fucking hard. Iâ€™m going to have to lie to everyone about it.,1
I drove the 10 minutes home with my fiance on the phone helping me count my breathing. I got home and collapsed. I couldn't breathe. My neck and chest hurt. I was hysterical.,1
"Today we had a really bad fight and sheâ€™s at home while Iâ€™m outside... I donâ€™t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go, with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do. Iâ€™m an 18 year old non binary and have had a shitty relationship with my mom ever since my dad left when I was 8. I live in a drug heavy area that is riddled with gangs and is definitely not safe at night. Shelters nearby are full, I donâ€™t have a car, and no friends or family to turn to.",1
"Therefore, it should probably come as no surprise that I sprung the question of ""What exactly are we doing here?"". Well, that backfired, as he alluded to the fact he was too freshly out of a long term relationship and didn't want to commit yet (Jason had been single for more than a year and it was a 3 year relationship). I bit my tongue until it bled and told him that was okay because we had more friends in common by that point, despite saying I needed some direct space for a few weeks or more. Unfortunately, what followed could have not been more violent. Not the type of physical violence, but emotional tension and turmoil fueled by running into each other at social settings and by alcohol.",1
"But I do not even think the therapist is supposed to actually care, she actually seems to, but I cannot understand it. I did not start therapy because I thought she would care, I started therapy because I jumped off a bridge 1 year ago and I have an 18 and 21 year old brother and sister who are too young to process a suicide, it would be wrong, so therapy is the thing I figured. Now I feel like it is all that I live for, a part of me really likes how kindly she is. But another part of me feels tied down these days, I am getting tired of this town and want to pick up my pack and go on down that open road just as I have 16 times in these past 15 years and she is the only reason I don't.",1
"I've been seeing the same one since then, and she'd helped me process so much, help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things... I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore. I care about him, his wellbeing, but...  That familial bond isn't there, he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff, a couple days after walking out... The only time I ever stood up to him. He made some snide remark about my mother, and I told him to go ahead and run from his problems like he always does, and he backed me into a corner and shook me, screamed over me when I collapsed, until my mother came home and made him leave.",1
"With all of this garbage happening to me, I find it hard to keep my chin up and to not be negative. By anticipating the worst and vocalizing it, I feel as though I have a better chance of avoiding the worst, because I'm still suffering (making myself unlikable or making a fool of myself). Additionally, if the situation turns out better than expected, I will be pleasantly surprised, and not let down when something goes wrong. Because of this, my relationship with my family is horrible as well. I don't want to lose one of my few friends over this, but I have no idea how to change or if such a thing is even possible.",1
"It feels great, but I'm worried. I tried to kill myself one year and one month ago. I am prone to depression. I am worried about crashing too hard, and I have kids to care for. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?",1
"Eventually I reported the texts, as they kept coming, and I recieved verbal backlash from his friends for doing it (I live in a small community, running into him or his buddies all the time).  Then, radio silence. I felt minor relief every day I didn't hear from him, or his friends. After his second appearance in court, he pled not guilty to charges of uttering threats and assault. I was shocked.",1
I don't know what to do right now. I'm having so much anxiety and I feel that there is no hope for me right now. It took a lot of effort to post this. I panic very easily. I also have trust issues.,1
"Help me out here, fellow anxious, if we gather maybe we could create an elaborate plan to help me avoid this, idk I have phone phobia. These are really important conversations that I'll be calling to have and a lot depends on my explaining things and my demeanour and a lot of things could go so terribly wrong and I'm just so absolutely socially inept and phone calls are one of the worst ways for me to say words and make sense and - please help. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”",1
I got upset and called the dogs in and closed the door. When he came in he avoided me at first and when I confronted him about lying and sneaking around he defended it by saying it's my fault that I'm not okay with it. I've never been okay with it and i feel like I've been lead on throughout this entire relationship. The fact that he would prioritizing getting high over comforting me really hurts my feelings. I'm tired of feeling like a plant is more important then me.,1
"I started to get depressed but was personally unaware. My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day. She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down. All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears. I told her I had been thinking about suicide.",1
"I wondered if anyone else had a similar place that they always found themselves in. I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space. I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out. Secondly; if it's not helping me recover, how can I make the rest of my house more appealing? I'm not consciously choosing to end up in the kitchen it's just where I go.",1
I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said â€œhey mom Iâ€™m in the hospital Iâ€™m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.â€ She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was. What do I do? I feel like Iâ€™m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear. I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me? She just sees me as the fuck up causing her annoyance.,1
"I'm trying to figure out what I learned that is good from it. but all I can think of is that I learned no one can be trusted including myself, people are inconsistent and unstable, people don't know themselves, if love exists then it doesn't mean much, and even if you truly believe that someone else cares about you and wants you in their life to the point where you finally don't question it, they can cut you off and start treating you like you're worthless without a moment's notice. the more I process what happened the more I realize there is truly no hope for me finding the kind of relationship I hope for, and there is really nothing else worth living for besides that. so, fun stuff. right?",1
"I'm gonna try and keep this as short as possible> We met 6 months ago and it was instant chemistry. We fell in love pretty quickly and we used to talk all the time about how surprised we were at our feelings and how we had never felt like this before. Anyway a month ago he started calling less, he would still drive the few hours to come and see me but the communication between us seeing each other was lacklustre. I'm not usually clingy but we used to talk on the phone several times a day. this turned into a 5 minute call.",1
"Since I was fifteen my stepdad, when he returns home from work, drunk. Always ask me to massage his naked back by stepping on it almost every night. Even if it's midnight, he'll make my mom wake me up, even tho I don't want to. But I'll comply because I was afraid to refuse as he could get quite angry if I do so. I don't know what's going on inside my mom's head at that time, but I just assume that she's too powerless, too afraid of my stepdad.",1
"I suddenly became very weak, dizzy, and tired..spending days in bed. Never had a real fever..docs put it down to a post viral fatigue from something I had caught..I would get better for a few days then I would ""crash"" again. It wasn't until I had had countless tests done that came back clean..and went to the ER one last time in desperation to figure out what was wrong that the doc sent me to the pysch as he suspected depression and anxiety (I had lost 10lbs by then..and didn't weigh much to begin with). I was diagnosed with moderate-severe clinical depression and anxiety..the pysch ruled out CFS and lyme etc since my symptoms would come and go and kept changing by the day. Was prescribed ssri meds..but this gave me the worst panic attack I have experienced in my life..aaand another ambulance ride..",1
"The man who abused me, his mother is a political figure. I SUSPECT she is using her wealth and influence to keep her sons abuse secret. The family has been blaming me for my abuse, denying it happened, threatenung me into changing my story, and generally defaming my character. I can't prove it but suspect this may have happened to a girl before me. Is there a way to expose this family?",1
"And really, that's why I'm typing this post. I want to know for certain if I was witnessing a domestic violence incident (feel free to delete this post if otherwise - again, this is a throwaway, so I don't mind), if there's anything I could and/or should have done differently there, and if there's anything I can do to help in case this happens again (which knowing my job, it will). I'm wondering if I should have slipped her info to a hotline, or lied about calling the police, or *something* - in the back of my mind, I keep telling myself there was something I could have done here. Any ideas?  EDIT:  In case it isn't clear, I DID call the police - I just didn't inform them of my domestic violence suspicions until they arrived, due to what happened between the call and their arrival.",1
"It sucks. I know I need help. I want to get help. I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer). I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.",1
"But, for now, and until I'm on the proper road to recovery, I just feel no need to have sex and it worries me more than anything. He says sex is natural and in-the-moment, but I find myself having to plan everything down to what to say and do in advance. Sex just doesn't come naturally to me. This has been posing a major threat to my sexual identity, and I fear if I initiate tomorrow I'll just burst into tears in the middle of it all. I'm so, so scared.",1
(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I wrote this as an example of what I feel on an average day so that people who don't have mental illness can understand) Hollowed out doesn't quite cover the feeling. Because inside this shell are millions of raw nerve endings feeling everything that brushes by. Everything is so raw. Between the mental and physical pain it's incredibly hard to stay grounded.,1
"I don't ""feel"" in this anymore, but I honestly can't tell if I just can't let bygones be bygones or if I'm looking at this objectively. If I do break it off, it's going to crush her personally AND add the awkwardness of her telling her friends and family its off. So I don't want to do it unless it's you know, really what's needed. And if I do leave, how do I mitigate someone who has threatened suicide at the action of me leaving? **edit**: Thanks everyone.",1
Heâ€™s claiming I beat him in that fight. I had to go to court and be treated like I was the abuser and the whole time he sat there next to me. A protection order was written and I nor my daughter can go home. I have a 30 day to vacate of face eviction from my landlord and I lost my job over all of this. My pre trial is next month and my lawyer seems like he has no idea about my case.,1
"Hello So I've had chronic social anxiety since I can remember. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, which has resulted in me being socially awkward, and very nervous in social setting. Fast forward to this week- I've been invited to a party this weekend. I would love to go, but to be honest, I'm very scared to go.",1
"I've been feeling off the past day where I felt I was gonna get sick and just felt weird, I'm at my dads house visiting and have diarrhea now and my back hurts, I think it's from this bed. And now I'm starting to tell myself maybe I'm having a heart attack. Maybe I felt chest pain a second ago, but can't tell if it was real or not?? Someone tell me I'm crazy and I'm ok",1
"I feel terrible because we never do anything fun. We never go to the zoo or go to the movies because itâ€™s usually too late and Iâ€™m too drained by the time I pick him up. Needless to say this lifestyle is absolutely killing me. I am miserable. I have zero friends, I see my wife a few hours a week because of our opposite schedules and Iâ€™m drained.",1
My sleep patterns are erratic because I don't want to sleep anymore. Is it normal to have PTSD with nightmares EVERY time I sleep? Every time? My psychologist has started trying to slowly desensitize me by showing me pictures and videos of what disturbs me: this is currently making things worse. How long until I start to see improvements?,1
"I'm fat, unattractive, unmotivated, and best of all six figures in student loan debt  and not even graduated yet! I'll never be able to afford living on my own so there goes the last little bit of hope for dating, though relationships don't seem great to me anyway. I've fucked up my future lol. I have constant stomach pains and stiff pains everywhere from all the anxiety I feel on 24/7 basis. Also my health is declining as well, so that's fun.",1
"Friends and loved ones (who don't have anxiety) keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it. Which I'm sure is 100% true but not matter how many times it's said anxiety never believes it. I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while. I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations, and this job pushed that (being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers) but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town. Does anyone have any advice or maybe gone thru something similar and came out on top?",1
"I donâ€™t know how itâ€™s physically possible to be this anxious on this level of medication. To be fair my anxiety and racing thoughts about going back to the first employer are so bad that I canâ€™t even really watch TV, so healthy coping mechanisms are pretty sparse. Iâ€™m really only posting this because I seriously canâ€™t believe that a) I can physiologically sustain this and b) that I still have been going to work every day. I guess I come home and break down every day too, so thereâ€™s that. I wish so bad I hadnâ€™t done that, and itâ€™s like my brain is living in this loop of both regret and fear, as well as rage at myself for thinking that would be the answer.",1
"I have a short term plan, but nothing long term at all. Iâ€™m assuming sheâ€™s going to shut off my phone in the next 24 hours, so Iâ€™ll have no access to texting or calling services until fiancÃ© can afford to put me on his plan. Unfortunately, he may lose his job because he was living with me and my mom. Today we had a really bad fight and sheâ€™s at home while Iâ€™m outside... I donâ€™t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go, with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do.",1
"I'm not exaggerating in that I legitimately, 100%, thought I was going to die. I don't think I've ever been so scared. I keep a diary and reading back on what I wrote at that time makes me cry at the memory. Something else new I've been experiencing is numbness. I've never felt numb before but it's been happening more lately.",1
"I feel so damaged by my childhood that I feel like I could never be fixed. Everything he's said is true about me. I am stupid, crazy, cunt, bitch, whore, and people only want me for my body. I feel so ready to just go. I hate myself so much.",1
"She hangs up; told me she was going to; but she leaves. That was a bit frightening. But I guess at that stage the police were already here, because the abuse from him starts. â€œOh you actually called the fucking cops did you?â€ â€œWhy would you call the fucking cops?â€ â€œI canâ€™t believe youâ€™d call the fucking copsâ€. Three days later, Iâ€™ve just checked the phone.",1
"My heart races and my hands start to sweat, I immediately feel as if I need to pee and then worry as thereâ€™s no bathroom (on the train at least). The unknown is the problem here â€“ how long will I be trapped? I know this is stupid â€“ I know I am fine, I know in all likelihood we will be moving again shortly, but itâ€™s the constant what ifs that set me off. I look around and everyone else looks perfectly calm â€“ perhaps mumbling at the inconvenience, but I am gripped with fear. I hate it.",1
"Let alone his assault charges from beating her, RIGHT? If it did, what would be her options with the issue of the lease she wouldn't be able to afford? I desperately want to help her with this situation. I feel like if I can help her and choose not to, anything that happens to her becomes my fault. I refuse to let that happen.",1
"I'm not mad, but it makes it very hard to compete as I'm quickly figuring out that my school was fairly easy and I did not try very hard. Which yes it is my fault, but I didn't think I was going to have to compete with the best of the best. Just know the course well. I have always been able to apply myself, endless amounts of will power with a drive to learn. So yeah I thought I could learn what I needed to know, but it's more than that, it's knowing EVERY little fucking thing about everything because that's how much everyone else knows.",1
"Needless to say that is all a lie from him, He is here from DSS/Social Services just like I am. What I am worried about is my safety and security. This guy is obviously mentally ill and a drug addict and alchie, and now I am really concerned that he will do something to me because I stood up to him and his nonsense bullshit. How should I proceed....Call Social Services and turn him in? or call the police next time he harasses me?",1
"I am not even sure what to say. My girlfriend was really, really mad. Not at my family, they're just basing this off what they hear, but at my sister. And honestly, I am really mad too. What the fuck could she be saying about me?",1
"And my nightmares are a terrifying mix of intense body horror and trauma flashbacks. So I wake up even more tired and in pain which makes me miserable during the day. So now I'm having my chronic pain flaring up, my other PTSD symptoms kicking my ass, my other mental illnesses acting up, and on top of that I'm too tired from the nightmares to do anything about it. I just can't fucking win. I'm so so tired.",1
"I can get from feeling super bad (aka anxiety) to feeling super good with just one single thought (they're, most of the times, exaggerated). And then, with another thought I can get from feeling super good to feeling super bad. This is a matter of just seconds and these switchs can last for hours, stop and then come back again. When I get the bad feelings it's just awful and the only way I can cope with them is thinking of a way of killing myself. Then, when I get the good ones, I completely forget about the sensation the bad ones gave me and I see the bright side.",1
It can take weeks until the problem is solved or I realise I was anxious over nothing. Recently I'm moving home due to family circumstances and it's something I didn't want to really do yet but I am having to and the place I'm moving to is lovely but I'm really anxious over it and whether I'm doing the right thing. These thoughts I'm having are causing this really dark awful feeling. Is this feeling common? I wondered if this feeling is my intuition but I don't believe it is I think it's purely anxiety.,1
"Hi everybody, I'm a 22 year old male who has had extreme depression and anxiety issues since I was 12 years old. I was also a competitive swimmer growing up and these issues started flaring up when I was moved into an age group with a very strict and demanding groups. 1.5 hour swimming sessions (4k yards) 6 days a week with a 30 minute dryland practice everyday or every other day, I believe. I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.",1
"Over the past couple of years I've been getting increasingly afraid of road trips. I've been terrified of dying in car accidents. I don't know entirely knowing where this fear is coming from. I was in a super minor fender bender as a teenager but that was it. In college, I lived in a city with insane traffic and regular accidents but I never experienced an accident myself.",1
This isnâ€™t so much a cry for help but I just want to rant about all my problems somewhere and this seems like the place. Iâ€™ve had anxiety for a few years now but this year Iâ€™m full on depressed. Iâ€™ve considered running away so many fucking time but I always feel bad for those Iâ€™m trying to leave. Iâ€™ve never self harmed (thankfully) but Iâ€™m always bummed out and paranoid. College is surprisingly the only thing that doesnâ€™t make me anxious.,1
"Perhaps as a result I feel awful about wanting more from him, I feel like it's incredibly ungrateful of me because he does do so much good for me and is really good to me in so many ways. Especially with my depression and stuff he deals with a lot of household stuff in addition to working way more than I do. I feel like shit for writing this post. **TL;DR - SO of over a decade is great to me in many ways and shit to me in other ways, I feel awful when he's shit to me but also feel guilty as fuck about expressing it because of all the times he's amazing to me. Wondering if this is emotional abuse and if it is, what can I do about it?",1
"I also get really painful cramps/periods every month. I do not share this with the people I work with because I do not want to ""complain"" nor do I think it is any of their business! Today, I asked to leave at lunch time, because I was in a lot of pain, I had terrible cramps, and actually bled through my pants! Embarrassing! The secretary told me it was no problem.",1
"I need help. My partner's house is a mess. That is an understatement, he has over 60 empty beverage containers on his coffee table, he has over 30 fruit flies flying around, and the odour is disgusting. I don't know what to do, it's getting harder and harder for me to go over there. It worries me because I am a clean person, everything has it's spot.",1
"And Iâ€™m scared all the time. I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories. And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and thatâ€™s even more isolating. Iâ€™m sorry. I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.",1
"Iâ€™m very concerned that I might never be able to put a condom on, last in bed or satisfy a woman with my penis. The girl was very satisfied and even exhausted and she said that it was the most times she cums in one night and that the previous guys just stuck it in and thrusted ( which Iâ€™m secretly jealous honestly since Iâ€™m concerned that I might not be able to stick it in right now). she keeps texting me now about meeting up again. She said Iâ€™m great with my hands and Iâ€™m a great kisser but she kept silent about my penis which I was apparently very bed using it. I kept my cool throughout the night and laughed it off and she was very cool and said that she was expecting it but Iâ€™m very concerned that I might have a deformity or something.",1
"my abuser is in my family, and i am in the process of healing but every family reunion/holiday i must see my abuser causing me to enter panic attacks, constant crying, and flashbacks, causing an uproar to what could make me so ""troubled"" I am afraid of coming out to my family in case of being removed for my family forever and damaging relationships. I have younger family members i am trying to protect so i feel alot of weight on my shoulders when i am having a bad PTSD episode around my abuser and my younger family members.",1
Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21. I never realised how much an effect these events had on me. There is another woman that I like (F32). She is very intelligent and we talk all the time. The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,1
"For some reason the niece decided to call us and basically tattle on the ex for how she was living drugs etc..... we kinda already know her situation. We have custody so it's not a huge deal. Well, he invited the niece we will call her CarlaÂ  and her bf to our home for a bbq.  Well, they never left, I don't even understand how it happened but it did . Well,Â  after major issues with the bf we finally were able to get rid of him.",1
"I cant function just having a hostile room mate, not needing to work, there's literally no way I can function homeless. I'm barely keeping myself from suicide at this point. I cant go into a residential care facility because they mistreat and abuse people extremely often in the united states, and I cant handle further abuse or I'll end up killing myself. Any ideas on what to do? thanks.",1
"I described my symptoms to friends and they would say its normal, or that they have thoughts of their own and that it's all in my head. But I knew this wasn't normal, I'm an optimistic person and I'm not afraid of people, I actually like socializing and meeting people, but my anxiety gets in the way and my fear of judgment.. but even I knew that I wasn't nervous, but my body was reacting in a way... idk how to describe it. I just wished that I could go for drinks with my girls and when guys came over, I wouldnt over analyze and get nervous... and start twitching because of all the rush of blood to my face... I dealt with this for years, and was going to just live like this... but then I went to a bar to meet up with my girlfriends but arrived late. Once in the bar I saw a group of guys sitting with them.",1
"The idea of what ISPs can do once the lack rules are truly active have made me feel sick to my stomach. I can't sleep and it is affecting my school life. I can't afford to pay ransom to the Corporate Fascist Thugs who wish to cableize the internet and I can't stand the idea of the internet becoming like that of China and North Korea. We are still fighting, but I'm still paranoid and every day that gets closer to April 23rd makes me feel more infuriated and panicky. I feel under attack and very life about to be destroyed.",1
"Now the past week, anxiety has hit harder than it's ever hit before. I'm checking snapchat scores, social media activitiy, last active etc which i know is already grounds for unhealthy relationships. The problem is when we were together, and whilst we were texting chat its absolutely perfect until the past week. The texts are shorter, my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end, there's no good night / good morning message, it's all very limited and short. I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.",1
"It seemed like there was no recognition of my emotional state and like he just wanted me to be quiet. That scares me. He claims he was trying to help comfort me, but I really am having trouble believing that. This is the second time something like this has happened. The first time was when we were arguing and it was getting really heated.",1
I told him Iâ€™m not using that on my makeup and my contacts stuff! Iâ€™m crying and yelling and he is yelling at me and shoving a broom in my face and I just tell him Iâ€™m taking all my stuff out of the bathroom so now itâ€™s on the shelves that I just cleared off. So >now the only thing of mine in the bathroom is my toothbrush and tooth paste. &nbsp; >I canâ€™t live like this.I canâ€™t be here anymore.,1
"So, my question is how worried should I be about this? Is it likely that this guy will come look for me or cause problems in the future? Or am I overreacting? What would you do if you were in my shoes? Thanks!",1
"I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault. I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking. This must mean that I am truly worthless and a waste of life. I feel like I'm not even allowed to feel like this, because I deserve this hard life. Has anyone experienced horrible burn out because of PTSD/OCD?",1
"I was feeling sick, I had work to do, I was tired, and all I could do was shout that I didn't want to be so close to the next step and get slingshotted back because of something I didn't know was coming. I know it's my fault. I know I should've been more careful, been more prepared. But I can't do this. My boyfriend has been begging me to keep the baby, and it makes me feel torn.",1
"My husband has poor impulse control (his words) especially when he gets angry or frustrated. I've noticed he often will take out frustration on the dog (he's a rescue who is legitimately hard to manage). He's never hit me or hit the dog, but he will often pull the leash too hard and go too far with discipline. For example the other day, the dog was having a lot of anxiety and being bad and barking in the car at every dog we passed. When we arrived home my partner got out of the car and pulled the dogs leash so hard that he fell out the door into his back.",1
"I donâ€™t have anything to ask atm or anything that anyone else need to know, but i cant go to someone when Iâ€™m not coping or in a state, I feel like itâ€™s something I have to ride out on my own, that I canâ€™t tell anyone about. I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family donâ€™t try to support me, I just donâ€™t want to see mum cry again because Iâ€™m broken and sheâ€™s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps. Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I canâ€™t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didnâ€™t have to go. So Itâ€™s been largely untreated, not throw lack of trying.  I canâ€™t see my condition changing.",1
"After I took care of healing my self, my biggest concern has been that he will do it again to another poor woman. He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past. I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship. It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency. I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.",1
"Help me network, help me find a room, please! ISO a room for rent as soon as possible. Looking for a roommate-type situation, a room in someone's house, etc. Not looking for full houses or units. I need as soon as possible--I'm dealing with an emergency situation and am losing my housing on Friday, August 11th.",1
"My boyfriend is currently stationed overseas while Iâ€™m still in the states with my four year old and our seven month old. It has been very hard for both of us, but I at least have the kids. I often feel guilty for feeling sad or lonely because he doesnâ€™t have anyone there. No friends (yet), family, and he misses our son terribly. Heâ€™s having a really rough time with missing all of the milestones of babies first year and is depressed often... when heâ€™s sad he gets angry.",1
"I just never had proper doctors who could diagnose me. There's a very long story there. I suffer from PTSD because I have been abused my entire life. I was physically abused by my teacher when I was 8 years old. My mother physically, mentally and emotionally abused me, up until I left her house at 16.",1
"I had no insurance but got expensive tests run to confirm that I was not having seizures. When that therapist suggested crystal healing I left and went to another one. After over six different therapists/psychiatrists I have received yet another diagnosis of PTSD, schizophrenia with mania, anxiety disorder, and depression. The meds are not working and I live in a small town where my mental health access has been exhausted. The last therapist told me after one visit that they ""aren't really equipped to deal with people like you (me).""",1
The problem is that I have zero support system. I have a job but I couldonly afford this motel room for a week and my dog followed me on foot for a few miles until we somehow got separated. He ended up at someone else's home and I want him back so badly. I have no way to go get him and I'm scared and alone and  I'm a Christian but I need someone to tell me it's going to be ok. Please.,1
"I just can't do it. Some days I think: ""You know what, i'll do it!"". But I never actually did it. There's a fucking huge wall, a Trump wall, stopping me. All I wanted was a job, now I got a job offer but the wall is stopping me.",1
Im so in love with my wife when sheâ€™s happy and herself. We have everything in common. But when she becomes abusive and manipulative itâ€™s too much and she says she will change and sheâ€™s taking meds now and she booked a counselor but I donâ€™t know if this is more manipulation and lies or if itâ€™s real? I just donâ€™t know. Sheâ€™s had soooo many chances to do this but only after we have separated is she ever actually doing anything about it.,1
"Long story short: 3 year old American Bully with severe encephalitis (brain swelling) which at this point is believed to be GME (an auto-immune disease). We are fighting for her so even if you don't want to make a donation or don't want to share the link, any positive thoughts are appreciated as well. My wife is 8 months pregnant & I had cancer earlier this year. We're struggling financially and need help.

"Ask a local representative for help? What are some steps I can take that I haven't yet? I'm scared, and so .... almost annoyed of dealing with this, he was served a protective order way back in October 2017. Also...how has he repeatedly had so much success with the police? It honestly baffles me, which is why I wonder whether he's paying them off (he told me he'd done this while we were together, although that could've been a fear tactic).",1
"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't. My brother was best man for our other brother's wedding, which I attended but declined being a bridesmaid, and kept a careful distance. Then I went home, drank an entire bottle of wine and cried while my husband comforted me). 2. I never would have known about my cousin's son if I hadn't been able to make the funeral yesterday.",1
"He was furious I'd 'kept' that from him. I had considered doing cam modelling though had never gone through with it (again before we even met) . He accused me of lying and keeping things from him. On top of that, he still expected sex all the time. I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1
"Sorry in advance, just need to get shit off my chest.. This has been a spectacularly shitty year to be homeless, trying to recover from health issues that have me terrified (and cut off from health insurance), facing criminal tresspass charges that turned out to be false, but took 8 months to prove my innocence, dealing with incompetent social services that JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT, to finally getting into what I thought would be a place safe against the weather, but turned out to be basically living in a refrigerator, and now I'm back on the streets with moldy fucking gear and all options here exhausted. I'm fucking sick, in pain, and nowhere to sleep but in a doorway in a town that hates (and I really mean hates) the homeless, and  all I can think of to do is hang on til I can GTFO, without getting the shit beat out of me. Anyway, thanks for listening, and for what it's worth, please everyone have a safe holiday.",1
its been 9 months now for our marriage and she managed to sleep with me with lights off as i cant even think of sleeping with lights on. now she is pregnant and its 8 months. now she wants to keep lights on in the room which i cant sleep with lights. what should i do ? is that behavior of my wife normal ?,1
"I also always bite and pick at my lips, meaning I usually have a patch of dried blood. I also chew my nails (though I've found if I clip my nails almost everyday it goes away). I know these behaviors are typical of OCD but I don't have other OCD symptoms so I think it's just my anxiety. Any tips would be appreciated. Or if you just want to share your habits go ahead.",1
"I used to always feel I loved him more than he does with me, that was a common fight. And it turned out to be sickly true. I care so much for that man, I place myself in his shoes and feeling the pain he must be feeling being alone. I know this is sick of me, but how do I stop this?! I shouldnâ€™t feel bad for what he did right?!",1
"It sucks because I work on a computer and type all day at work and do needlepoint and sewing as a hobby and I can't do those things when it's this bad. Of course when people (family, coworkers, friends) see the brace they ask what happened. I always blame carpal tunnel. I feel so angry that I am still covering up for my abuser. I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.",1

"During this time, my mother was out of work and she had to make sure she took the time to take care of her father. On his deathbed, my grandpa told our landlord, to his face and perhaps in a Will (the latter was my mother's words, not mine) that he did not want his daughter and his granddaughter to be homeless. He wanted him to take care of us and make sure we had a place to live. Unbeknownst to me, we were behind on the rent. I didn't know how much until a few years later, when I got my first job.",1

I think that's what it's called. Where you relive your trauma and talk about it to take the emotional response and power away. I am just nervous and very scared. Has anyone did this kind of treatment? Did it help?,1
"I loved that man so much and tried my best to make it work. But I have limits. And when he was not thinking twice about getting alcohol while we didnâ€™t have even enough money left for milk for our baby, that was my limit. We had .51 cents in our account and he found that acceptable? !",1

"When I went back the next day he said the good news was he wasn't going to lie to me anymore. He said ""if you can take a raping like that and still come back, there's nothing I could do to make you leave."" And ""There's no point in lying any more"" He always told me from then on when he was cheating, doing something wrong, etc. I thought about turning him in. I took some pictures on my phone to maybe show the police.",1
"I find myself curious if any of you have experienced a partner who with holds sex and affection as part of their abuse pattern. I mostly read about men who force or otherwise guilt/manipulate their partners to have sex. My situation is different. My husband refuses to touch me. If I try to initiate sex which I have done many times in the past, he will flat out push me away.",1
"The problem is that she won't accept the fact that I want to break up. She says I'm not giving a good enough reason. And she wants me to keep talking to her because I'm her only good friend that she can talk to and thinks she can win me back. I'm a pretty nice guy, and I feel bad for her because I know she struggles with making friends, and I feel like an ass if I just leave her. Help me reason with myself that this is a good idea to leave her and stop communication.",1
"I'm afraid of losing who I was. I went into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and for the first time in a year, I feel like I saw my own reflection.

"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up. I want so bad to do the work, be better, and show kindness to those who have been so kind to me.

"It started off small, but it's getting larger and larger by the day to the point that I want to cry. All I want to do is sleep, but no matter how much I sleep, I'm still exhausted. I sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep. I fuck up my school life by sleeping so much. Why am I still tired.",1
"I grab my partner and told him â€œ we need to get out of here right fucking now!â€ We made hour way out of the building, as we were exiting the conditions increasingly got worse, just as we made the door the room flashover, my partner was already in the hallway I was still in the room. Many times when firefighters are caught in a flash over the outcome is death, for me it was burns to years, wrists, and face. I still consider myself very lucky. After that I started struggling with anxiety at work and home. On my days off I started to drink excessively.",1
"If you haven't outgrown that by your early 20s, I think there's possibly a problem. She thinks these comment wars she gets into are funny, and turning people's words around on them and baiting them is her idea of having fun. She's delighted when someone gets mad at her. I don't see how this can be fun to anyone unless they have a teenager's mindset. She does this on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook mainly.",1
"Hello r/ptsd. I'm currently almost 19 but suffered a lot of traumatic events within my immediate family between the ages of 10-15. Earlier this year, I noticed that I had terrible body odor (I shower and wear deodorant everyday) whenever I left the house. This was obviously accompanied by some unbearable anxiety, as well as very severe panic attacks. After talking to my psychiatrist and a therapist, they diagnosed me.",1
"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family. I felt I had to protect them; They were already insolved with CPS (Trust me, though, they're awesome) and I knew if i brought abuse into our case, I would inevitably send them down an unnecessary path. Social workers don't blame the abuser, they jump to the conclusion of negligent parents; Parents who were irresponsible enough to not know this was going on. They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know. I went out for a few hours and they assumed I was hanging out with my friends, at least that's what I planned to do; They assumed I went to school and got an education, not beatings when the teacher was out of the room.",1
The best idea i have came up with is use the lazt of my petrol to get somewhere atleazt half close to work and safe and legal to park up where i canalso sleep. Use my anti bactiral gel to clean my body and just wear a hat all week for work and wait it out until friday. Does anyone else have any better advice? Id appriciate any suggestions. Thank you,1

"I can't stop feeling miserable. It's not even because my ex is going crazy, because he's once again proven I don't get to control my own life. I can't let go of the prosecutor telling me I only hear what I want. I don't even know what he was referring to, but it has to be true because I honestly don't remember agreeing to dismiss he case. I'm guess I'm not doing as well as I thought, and I must be as crazy as I now feel.",1
"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",1
"Fast forward to 3 am, I am tired and would rather just leave, even though we have convenient seats in a standing room only club and my wife is enjoying herself. She makes a passing comment that she would likely be more comfortable at home, eating food. I jump on this and say we should walk back even though it is a 45-minute walk, in heels, in the rain (which I did not check for). She agrees we leave, she slips and falls, I did not help her up, and we fight the entire way home, divorce comes up several times. This morning she won't get out of bed and won't talk to me.",1
"I gathered my composure, went back and sulked until I was asked if I could put something in my eye sight to block it out. I got a little excited, found a huge box and was able to move on with my day.. until about 3 when the owner came over, moved it, and then asked me if I was keeping it for anything. I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative. Stupid me for thinking dozens and dozens of instant in your face surprise red circles could ever equate to negativity.  I guess I have a new trigger.",1
"Advice on how to deal with friend? And advice about how to deal with the impact of this on myself? Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad. But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame. I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it.",1

"For context, I'm working through my last year of grad school, living alone currently with not many strong friendships in the area, and my Dad has been dying of cancer since September, so it's a stressful and lonely time. At first, I was quite excited about getting married. But for the last 3 months or so, all it does is fill me with dread and worry. When I've visited her, I've found myself falling into a deep funk. I often find myself wishing she would break up with me.",1
"When I was 16 my braces were removed due to bone loss caused by Pre-juvenile periodontitis. My orthodontist had advised against a retainer because of cost and not believing I would need it. So sometime around my 17th year my teeth began to shift, horribly. Now I'm left with a horribly crooked and hanging front tooth, and have been terrified to speak to, or smile at anyone for years. It's absolutely destroyed my self esteem, and I've contemplated suicide many times because of it.",1
"I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me. I am indian and he is white. I have been in the US since I was 6 and if you ever spoke with me on the phone, you would never be able to guess that I am indian.",1
"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever). It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well. However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world. That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me. On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1
"He knew about this. He asks me if I want to stop. I'm violently sobbing, so yes, of course I want to stop. He holds me for a couple of minutes. And then he starts talking about T again, even though we'd broken up the sexual arrangement months ago.",1
"I keep getting sudden, very short panic attacks. Or anxiety attacks. I'm not sure if I feel fear, I don't even know what the feeling is because I forget everything short term afterwards. They last a presumably short amount time and is the worst feeling imaginable to me. Some random thought I can never remember triggers it (it's definitely something that repeats though, it's a familiar feeling afterwards).",1
"Now while yes it could have taken me 30 minutes to figure out the bleach ratio, it was weird because once it was 2:30 I realized it was time to make the kids snack, and I went to look for the little baskets we put the food in and they were gone. I was frantically looking for them and I asked my coworker if she saw them, she explained in a confusing manner that she already made snack. And if she made snack she would have been right in front of me because we were in a very small kitchen. And if I were ""there"" I definetly would have known. And when I came out of this ""blackout"" I was really groggy and anxious.",1
Iâ€™m struggling to figure out whatâ€™s wrong with me at the moment. Iâ€™m wondering what caused you all to find out that you may have PTSD? Was it something you noticed yourself? Did family members point it out? Etc.,1
"I wanted to plant a new chapter in my new city, but haven't had time to devote to making it happen yet. I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death. My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power play-type problems. For example, I'll request *four times* in three different mediums we use, to email contributions to an end-of-year favorites list and rather than do that, she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing. Emails are met with snarky responses or half-measures which mean I still have to chase down.",1
"Today I also had to write down all the emotions I could think of then put a color next to each word that I felt â€œmatchesâ€ the emotion with markers. And the next page Thereâ€™s an outline of a human body. I had to put each color(emotion) where I feel it on my body. Iâ€™m slightly annoyed because before all of this sheâ€™s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like sheâ€™s being demeaning? Should I just see where this takes me or let her know that this feels slow and pointless at my appointment next week ?",1
"But I have something I think is important enough to at least be worth your time. Iâ€™m getting the word out about my wifeâ€™s surgery fund. She just got the message back today from her workplace denying her disability for her surgery. ðŸ˜¦ Long story short this was devastating for us, we are both pretty frugal people that try to save our money but sadly (at 20 and 19) we havenâ€™t had much time outside of home to amass enough savings. This surgery is a catch 22 however as if she doesnâ€™t get it she will have a 75-80% chance of becoming either wheelchair bound or if sheâ€™s luck just unable to ever walk up or down stairs.",1
It makes sense to see danger around every corner. But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark. I read a story the other day about someone who couldn't work anymore and just needed to be at home. . .,1
"I feel like at this point, I'm the only one putting effort into our relationship. I've suggested taking time to ourselves so that he could think things through, taking a break, talking about it, meeting up (we really only can see each other on the weekends due to classes), etc. Still, the short responses. He's started to not respond to me; we talk through an app that shows when the other has read the message. I know his class schedule, so I know when we can answer back (he checks his phone often).",1
"Usually after each session I get a headache also. I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now. The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious. Ive had a few hospital visits because after some sessions i turn into a hypochondriac because the physical responses are so odd. One session made the left side of my face numb.",1
"I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that. I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off. We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit. I thought I had calmed myself back down so I went into our office. He came into the office all furious.",1
"I was working on this so hard and spent all of my money... and I just failed my driving test. Now the idea of retaking it gives me a panic attack. I started learning how to drive 4 years ago, and it was okay until I got this driving instructor. 90% of the time when I should be learning, he would be lookig on his phone and he would never point out any problems so I felt rather confident to finally try and get my license. In my country you first have to pass the test with your instructor and just then in an official institution.",1
"I can't go anywhere without and inhaler and I tested positive for asthma even though I've never had an issue before all this happened. I'm on busphar, celexa, and atomoxetine and I've been on them longer than the hallucinations and such. I don't know what to do. I feel like I should go to get psychiatric help but now that I'm in college and only working part time I'm scared of not being able to pay the doctor bills. I don't know what to do.",1
"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, â€œIf this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I donâ€™t want to go back to the psych ward.â€ She stopped and just said â€œoh, ok sorry.â€ I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling. I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didnâ€™t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved? Thank you for reading and I appreciate any and all responses.",1
"I can't afford a treadmill and I'm not a big fan of gyms (plus there's none really nearby), so I'm trying to use really the one option available: going outside. This is a real problem for me and my anxiety. I feel like a gasping hippopotamus when I try running and am too embarrassed to let anyone see me like that, so every time I see a car or person, I stop running and immediately go back home. I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).",1
Iâ€™m really tired. It seems like the moment that Iâ€™m starting to recover or Iâ€™m starting to get some sort of progress. I get triggered and I have to start all over again. Itâ€™s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time. I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1
"Three of them said ""so sorry I actually can't"" and gave some noncommittal excuse, whether that was work or school related (even though school only started up again about a week ago and midterms are far away). I was disappointed but figured that it happens and I can still have fun with the three other people that are coming. Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"". I was so upset the entire day. I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends, since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that, plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",1
"Another time I had one was today in class. I was worrying about fainting because I fainted last week and didn't want it to happen again. Today I was feeling dizzy from worrying and I was thinking ""I need to get out of here."" I managed to calm myself down by taking deep breaths and closing my eyes before it got too bad. Can someone tell me if these were actually panic attacks?",1
"People say ""follow your gut"" but I don't even know if I have a gut feeling on this anymore because I have obfuscated it so much and overthought it to exhaustion. People have told me this is really no big deal in the long run but it feels absolutely monumental to me and will be something affecting me the rest of my life. Can any of you relate? How do you make really tough, lifelong decisions like these if you have anxiety? Thank you.",1
"I don't think I have the means of moving out. I got my review in Dec. and I was supposed to get a raise if I did well, but they gave me a bonus instead and I know I should be grateful I got anything but it wasn't what I needed and I can't get another job at the moment, nothing in the area is hiring for more than what I make at the moment. But I don't know what to do with my family. Just this morning I heard my sister telling my parents, they should like her more because she is the winner and I am not. I think she was talking about jobs - she recently got hired at a private university and is making great money, has excellent benefits, and could help her get her Masters.",1
I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic. I can't even admit it to myself. It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone. How can I see a therapist if I'm afraid I'm going to lose my shit just opening up about that one day? I feel like it would ruin any progress I've made...I'm afraid I'm going to be hiding forever.,1

Sadly, since I'm in a dorm, it's a shitty hallow core door and it broke bad and now there is a hole that I have to figure out how to fix. It's a $100 fine if I can't figure out what to do with it so that's just compounding on the already existing stress. I have $3 to my name right now, I luckily get paid Friday so I will be able to pay for my car, but I'm still left with only $100 for 2 weeks and I have to figure out how to pay for my textbook for my night class.

"I didn't even realize I was doing it until I felt the coldness on the skin of my temple. I thought I would feel fear but all I felt was relief and how easy it would have been to end my overthinking, torturing anxiety brain. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression officially at 12. I have severe insomnia and crippling anxiety constantly which leaves me to overwhelming dark depression. I think about everything I've said and done and it feels like fight of flight all the time.",1
"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).

"My question: how do I heal from this? As much as I wish there were a way to go back and fix my relationship with her, she deserves to heal from the damage I've done, and I have no right to ask for anything -- and so I won't.

"Given the diagnosis she refuses to take her prescribed medicine which is a cause for concern to me as when she is on a low, she tends to be very apathetic and rude in responses to conversation or ideas of things we can do. We live together in a house with two other people. We have our own space but the common area is shared. She has expressed that she doesn't like the living situation but the fact that it is cheap and we are all locked into a lease has prevented me from making any changes. After our lease is up I want to look for a place that the two of us both like but I am afraid it may be all for nothing.",1
"I have some tainted memories with my dad and have doubts about my grandpa. Anyway I don't control when some of these memories and questions pop up. I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage. I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone.

Unfortunately, I'm also more or less repressing all my feelings, and I'm having trouble with mood swings (particularly anger), anxiety and more recently, daily migraines. Any suggestions? Particularly suggestions for someone who works 40+ hours a week, so doesn't have much time to relax anyway? I hate living here, but don't have much choice for the foreseeable future.",1
"Please tell it to me JNMIL, I just don't know what to think any more. Am I unempathetic? Am I in a JNMIL situation with a FH who can't be helped? **TL;DR** My fiancÃ© has banned me from asking questions about his relationship with his mother, after I questioned the need to visit her for the fifth time in five days (4x+/week since we moved in together). Edited to add: I have often turned up and helped.",1
"WARNING: Messy post, I'm really all over the place, sorry guys. I have a lot on my mind. Hope you can make the best of this text. Also sorry for any spelling errors, english isn't one of my talents. Me and my boyfriend has been dating for over a year now.",1
"I can afford it alone. He just has nowhere else to go. His wages are low, he relies on me for transportation. I actually have to leave my job during the day to drive him to work. It is tough on me to do that.",1
"I can't remember what was in the marital home when I left. I left under duress. I am still piecing together weird, incongruous chunks of time, flashbacks, disjointed memories, and trying to figure out what happened; it seems like my brain just can't access specific details when I'd like it to. The problem here, other than everything, is that I don't feel like my attorney gets why I'm such a useless participant right now, and I could use some advice on explaining it. Do I have my therapist call my attorney?",1
"If it helps, I just started taking a new birth control thatâ€™s a bit stronger than what I was on before, so Iâ€™m relatively sure thatâ€™s why I feel bad RIGHT NOW. But itâ€™s still bad enough that I canâ€™t do much for myself, and I just donâ€™t understand why they canâ€™t believe that. I think they must see me as a burden or something because it seems like they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worth helping if my problem stems from anxiety rather than a different(â€œrealâ€) illness. and theyâ€™ve decided they are the judges of that, not me or my doctors. I just donâ€™t know what to do.",1
"She is very sweet and I love her immensely. I can't leave her where I am currently for fear of her being neglected. She is very attached to me. I will have no choice but to live in my car for the foreseeable future, which leaves me with the issue of what to do with her. I can't keep her locked in my car all day.",1
"Either way, I canâ€™t see anyone genuinely liking me. My mum sincerely told me she loved me a few days ago, and I had a hard time believing that. I hate to diminish her own thoughts and feelings, but I felt as though sheâ€™s deluded to be able to love me. Anxiety sucks. I wish I could look at things rationally and objectively.",1
"So I'm unemployed, broke, no car or drivers licence (its suspended due to unpaid tickets). Unemployment ran out a month ago and I have no savings. I got a 5 day sheriff lockout two days ago and have until Monday morning to clear out. I pretty much have to leave my stuff behind because I can't afford storage nor can I take it with me on the streets. I'm in the San Fernando valley, Los Angeles County California.",1
"So I've been taking Zoloft for several months and it has been working well for anxiety/depression but I'm having some problems with it. The biggest problem is that my mind feels blank a majority of the time. When conversing with other people sometimes I feel as if I have nothing to say. I feel as if I am less witty, and also less creative. I've backed down my dosage from 100mg to 50mg with some success as I don't feel as 'spaced out'.",1
"I have a day off from school and I was going to walk about 3 miles, from Sun City to the lakes of Menifee today (to get a free phone because I am on EBT and my phone broke recently). I have not eaten breakfast or any food for a while. I know I have asked and received before and I am grateful but I don't think mentally I can handle not eating something today. Help or no help, Thank you for reading my message, hope you have a good day!",1
"However my job is physically laborious as I start at 2 a.m. and don't wrap up until 1 p.m. I'm currently relying on co-workers get to and from since my car is out of order, so I don't have time to run to the supermarket to ask any of them to help me buy groceries to pay them back later. I've run out of the pantry food, and ended of my work day early today due to feeling sick. I'm assuming it's a stomach virus, as I was home by 10:30 a.m. today, slept for a few hours, and ended up hurling everything in my stomach by 2:30 p.m. Please, I need a hot meal, even if it's from the local Chinese place.",1
"I'm upset, and the fact that I don't know whether I should be upset is making me more upset. I realize there's something crazy privileged about the whole thing (parents want me to spend more money? i should xpost to r/firstworldproblems!) If this really is an absurd thing to worry about, sorry for making you read through this thesis but please do let me know because I'm just really confused and sad. TL;DR: Mom accuses me of not valuing the benefit of earning money because I don't like to spend it, though getting a good job is pretty much all i've been focusing on.",1
"I didn't understand why he wanted to get me an erection, and I certainly didn't want him to do that to me, but he did. I think I was around 11 at the time It's been 10 years. My relationship with that cousin isn't a bad one as of now. Remembering all these things has caused me some distress, even though I doubt if this event qualifies as abuse...",1
Today it all came to a head when no amount of uppers or downers was leveling me out. I had a meeting to run at 1. I had lunch with a customer at 12. I had a calls all morning...and you know what? I couldn't do it.,1
"Hello everyone. I am wondering what experiences people have with using Mirtazapine as their main antidepressant for depressive and anxious symptoms (low energy, heavy feeling, irritability, concentration problems, insomnia, inability to complete mundane everyday tasks, social anxiety, fear of embarrassment, worry or overthinking about socialization, etc)? I am in therapy using a mixed method approach so suggestions of therapy aren't relevant. I have just begun proper psychotherapy, and I am looking for something to help me when dealing with reality outside the therapist office. My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.",1
"I have the scars, medical records, injuries, memories, and nightmares. I know it's caused me to suffer from CPTSD. But has it caused me to lose my mind? I can't remember agreeing to dismiss. I don't understand the response email, and I refuse to assign meaning by reading into her response.",1
"Edited to add: I am unable to work, my disabilities are worsening frighteningly quick and I have no doctor, plus I keep getting dismissed at the ER. I've been struggling more and more with breathing and movement, I even had to start using a wheelchair. I have severe digestive issues and they've gotten so much worse I bleed when I go to the toilet. I'm in chronic pain and chronic nausea, it's like having the stomach flu forever stuff keeps coming out. So I *really* can't work.",1
"I won't defend myself, I know I shouldn't have raised my voice and I should have left much much earlier. I know who I am. That said.. Every day, I see a look that tells me a person I know loathes me. A thin veneer of social platitudes to cover a roiling hatred. I don't know what to write past this point.",1
I knew something was up with me. My thoughts were consuming me. Couldnâ€™t sleep. Stressed. Worried about anything and everything.,1
night sweats (bed stinks so bad and I have to wash the sheets daily and my bedroom is 68 degrees and I only sleep with sheets.) night terrors (re-occuring dream: waking up with the feeling that I am supposed to tell someone something to prevent an awful occurrence from happening but unable to say the words. The words just won't come out) Wife scared to wake me up because I am fearfully jumpy and suffer from panic attacks upon awaking. depression,1
"I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms. I feel I'm just lying to myself. I probably just want attention. I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"". I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
Shortly after anxiety set in. Not a totally unfamiliar feeling but there wasn't any clear indication as to why I Was feeling this way. Let me explain why I can't go over the fact that this feels different this time. 2 Usually there is one thing single thing that triggers my anxiety.,1
"I'm not against working my ass off, I'm just getting down right now, no responses to applications can do that. I'm in a state that doesn't even have a real art school. I have no funds whatsoever, no family to help, I don't know where to go from here? Like how do you even apply for scholarships? How do I not starve to death if I can get to art school?",1
"So I got freaked out and cancelled again. Now Iâ€™m worried theyâ€™ll find out about it later and send me to collections to damage my credit and ruin my life without me ever knowing. I hope this sounds crazy to everyone else as well because itâ€™s eating me alive. Nothing helps at this point, not even medication. Why do I always do this?",1
"Hello people of this sub, recently i think im suffering with a light case of stress. I constantly think about dying and it terrifies me, especially after learning that stress can kill you. I dont really feel any of the sympthoms that usually come with stress like loss of apetite and rarely i haver my heart beating too fast and i wanted to know if my situation can turn into something worse like an heart attack or something like that. I know that my case isnt the worse one but it still freaks me out. Thanks for the help.",1
I get home and go to bed and then struggle getting up in the morning. Iâ€™m trying so hard but I feel like I just canâ€™t get it right. I feel stupid for literally everything Iâ€™ve done in life so far and the way Iâ€™ve gone about things. Iâ€™m terrified that letting this out will ruin me. I try so hard to pretend everything is ok and I just canâ€™t anymore.,1
"I have anxiety ptsd depression and a severe eating disorder, she has severely crippling anxiety she needs meds for that we have to pay out of pocket for.

"This time, the school is way bigger and there are so many rooms scattered around the school. Just worried that I wonâ€™t be able to find my class. How am I supposed to know where my room is? This school is so large. Iâ€™m not ready for this.",1
"I get where she's coming from, but only if there had been inappropriate conversation or actions on my or my ex wife's part. My ex wife and I have literally zero feelings for each other, other than friendship and concern for one another as we are our son's parents. I don't know really what to do at this point. Maybe someone can give me some insight? ---",1
"My mom is living on borrowed time and she needs cardiac surgery. The whole thing costs around â‚¬8000 ($11800) and needless to say, we can't afford it. I'm on my way to becoming a doctor myself (in my final year of med school) and seeing her like this without being able to do anything to help her is breaking me. I love her so much. We have no one else and the constant pressure is killing me.",1
"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets. It sucks. But it's kind of relieving at the same time because while I'm broken I'm not choosing to be dramatic. I'm not just being manipulative. It's not my fault.",1
"And no friends are close enough to help her. Additionally, she is kind of scared of strangers because of her past of abuse. I live in a different country so I cannot help her as best as she needs. She has attempted suicide multiple times. I have been successful in saving her every time - with throwing up the pills and or calling an ambulance or whatever may be necessary.",1
"I was sexually abused when I was a kid and I suspect that I have PTSD because of it. I've never been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have been diagnosed with agoraphobia. I rarely leave my house. I'm not really anxious about leaving my house and once I get somewhere, I'm usually fine. I just have a very strong feeling of not being able to leave my house.",1
I have been trying to find an answer to this question over 6 months. My story starts when I changed while my life for the man I loved by believing him that he loves me and moving to California from Israel. Since I was the one who were going to take the big step I had many concerns yet he always literally begged me to move here... finally I did move here and we got married. After a while I found out from a Facebook message that he has been cheating on me all those time that he was begging me to move in with him. I asked him about the message and he lied about it over an hour.,1
"So, Kim Jong Un actually gave a rare, personal response to Donald Trump's speech and my god is it chilling. He mentions late in the speech that he is thinking about his hardest response possible to Trump's speech at the U.N. and even threatens to tame the 'dotard' with fire. My thoughts: This is bad. Really bad. Who knows what he could be planning?",1
"My anxiety was never too bad, lots of what ifs and such. But every summer I come home from school, or it gets so much worse. I love school. I love learning computer science, I love working on my projects. But this small town has 0 CS options for jobs, so I'm stuck working these dead end temp factory jobs all summer.",1
"On the off days where I don't remember them I still wake up feeling tired, wake up multiple times. I just feel like I cant sleep like normal. Any advice on what else I can do? Should I try to get a sleep study done? Ways to get out of the funk these put me in?",1
I have NOONE to talk too. = stress I've taken dbt/cbt classes. Yes I've tried grounding techniques and get frustrated after a bunch don't work. Cannot Afford a pyscologist.,1
Another issue is that both women are on the autism spectrum. My wife is quite high on it and the woman is quite low on it. My wife seems to think that there is nothing wrong with our marriage but we have not been intimate for 10 years. It's really hurting. I just don't want to hurt anyone but I know deep down that it's me that's hurt.,1
"I really don't know what's wrong with me lately. It seems like every day I'm having some kind of meltdown and I don't know how to get back to normal. The other night I had a massive flashback, no idea what triggered it. It came out of nowhere. And for about two weeks now I feel constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack.",1
"My bf and I went to his parents place in Iowa over Christmas. Over the years, I have always known that his parents don't absolutely love me but I didn't realize that they actually dislike me until this time I visited them. His dad is a difficult person to begin with, which is well known by everyone and he kept making little jabs at me and insulting me. For example, he asked if I am a citizen and how long I have been one, I mentioned that I have never watched Harry Potter and he ""jokingly"" asked me if I was busy clubbing and talking to boys and doubted my upbringing, and when I was using my bfs phone, he asked me why I am using it and if I am reading his texts. These are just a couple examples and there are many more.",1
"Child protective services were called and I was interviewed. I told them nothing of the sexual abuse, only the physical and emotional, as well as his constant threats to ""break your arm in that goddamn door if you don't sit fucking still"" I was removed from my home in two days and placed in a foster home until my biological father could drive up and take me to what was supposed to be my real home. On my mothers side of the family I have an aunty and my nene along with various cousins. My father kept me separated from them for two years, finally relenting when I cried and begged to see them.",1
"What is going on? What has happened, and what do I do? I still feel that my sanity, happiness and stability are better than they have ever been but this is an anvil on my head. Hashtag ???????????????????????????????????? ?",1
"But I really do enjoy being with him and don't want to break up either. Am I being silly? Sometimes I think I'm making this a bigger deal than it should be. I get insecure about the fact that my high school boyfriend is the only one who actually asked me out on a date before we slept together. Every other guy it's always turned out the same- I come on to him, we have sex for a while and the guy maintains he wants nothing serious, then out of nowhere comes on really strong with marriage and kids talk.",1
"His refusal to admit to anything though has me worried this is part of ongoing deception/cheating. When he completely denies knowing anything about it I just don't know what I can do with that. It feels like my options are to get over it/give him the benefit of the infinitesimal doubt or leave him over the inferred deception. I guess I have mostly just let it go but then every so often I remember about it and can't help but wonder, am I a colossal idiot, is he taking me for a ride? **Tl;dr** Found an okcupid profile for my husband, he denies knowing anything about it",1
How do I know if I need help? Please I need help understanding. I can't even explain my problem in this state. I don't know how to do anything in this state. I need to make sure I won't die.,1
"Weird title I know but I really couldnâ€™t find any other way to describe what Iâ€™m feeling and I really struggled to think if I should post this on here or another group So for as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve always been attracted to women and only women I had absolutely no interest in men at all A few years back I had my first relationship which was really manipulative and physically abusive and I havenâ€™t been on any dates since then Recently though (like in the last two weeks) itâ€™s accused to me that bar an old crush from before my ex â€œkinda-sortaâ€ coming back I havenâ€™t found any women attractive at all in a while at least a year and whenever I see someone I would have normally found attractive I just get a nervous/uncomfortable feeling I canâ€™t really describe Iâ€™m not sure if this is a response to how my ex used to get abusive if she thought I was attracted to her (like sheâ€™d insist I must want to rape her if I called her beautiful for example) and I know for a long time afterwards I felt disgusted with myself if I found someone attractive so this may just be the next step in that, like my mind doesnâ€™t want me to feel bad for finding someone attractive so it stops finding people attractive",1
"Because any potential new employer is always going to ask why I got kicked out of the academy, and as soon as drugs are mentioned, there's no fucking way I can compete with anyone else. And they'd probably want to talk to one of the bosses that fired me as reference to see if I'm lying, so I doubt I could cover it up. On top of this, there is no fucking way I can go back to my hometown. The family I have there will be so embarrassed and let down. They've been really proud of me and telling everyone about what I do for a living.",1
"Is it also possible that since I was so young, my mind distorted and hid these memories to make them less painful? I don't know what brought them back. I'm not in therapy nor have I been actively seeking any type of ""breakthrough"". I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 by a close friend's boyfriend, and the memories didn't come back then. What I feel right now, is mirroring how I felt then but honestly it might be worse.",1
"I'm constantly worrying, snapping off at my kids or even total strangers over trivial things, and have panic attacks so bad that I shake and can't catch my breath. The dr was very nice and understanding of what I was going through. She prescribed Buspar, which i'm not very familiar with. If you are or have taken it, how helpful was it for you? I realize everyone is different but just looking for general experiences, or anything else I need to know about it.",1
He goes in the bedroom and we only have one car so he has to take me to work. He is just sitting on the bed and I have to be at work in literally 16 minutes (I live close to my work). I said come on you're going to make me late and he said well find the fucking car keys. So I started looking then he found them. Then honestly he was just going on and on and yelling at me and I tuned out what he was saying so I don't even remember.,1
"This past week he's gotten really bad where he told her she couldn't use the house phone, her cell phone, the computer, the car, or even watch tv. He even stopped eating food that my mom makes and starting making his own for himself. Yesterday I atleast bought my mom a new cell phone and added her to my plan. He hasn't improved in the past week whatsoever. This was the last straw for me and I want to move out in the next 2 months and ask her to live with me temporarily.",1
"I am alone, and I don't know what to do. At this time I'm most interested in any 'quick tips' that can be offered on how to manage feelings of violation, betrayal, humiliation, distress, anger at the abuser and all those who stood by, ignoring the damage she was inflicting, anger at those who have protected her at the expense of her victims, anger at my family for their mistreatment, and how they effectively set me up for future abuse. Dissociative symptoms are a significant problem at this time. Focusing on a movie, tv show, video game, book, even a short song can be impossible at times. The interest in 'quick tips' on how to manage those overwhelming emotions is an attempt to make it feasible to read a fre books I'm hoping might help (Pete walker's CPTSD and James Chu's Rebuilding shattered lives, MacKenzie's Psychopath free).",1
"He has done it to lots of people and says every night that he is going to kill himself but then never does anything. Not even self harm. This also affects my family life as I come home everyday feeling stressed and this causes conflict in my family. (I still live with my mum and she works hard and travels a lot so she is also stressed) so I try to bottle it in to not give her more stress but then it eventually comes out in the form of arguments, because we both try to bottle in our emotions, so we end up falling out and both feeling very upset. Please can someone help me find a way to cope with all of this, it would mean a lot to me.",1
I remember what it felt like to not be anxious one on medicine. none of the other ones I've been put on take any of the edge off. I can't even play xbox live without holding my breath because I get anxious that people can hear me breathe. I mute my mic to give my lungs a reprieve and then go back to holding it. thanks for reading my little rant.,1
I donâ€™t know what to expect. I just want to not be so alone. He is a law enforcement officer in this small town. Iâ€™ve been down this road with him before. The injuries have never been so severe though.,1
She has been cheated on after being married and while pregnant and about to have her baby. She has been gone through it and knows how it feels to be hurt and lied too and said she will never do it to anyone as sheâ€™s been through it and is the type of person that wears her heart on her sleeve. I completely trust my husband but this is harder then I thought. Hard because I see her messaging him everyday day as soon as she wakes up and stays talking to him on the phone too. Hard because they still want to see each other.,1
**tl;dr: My BF has a dirty house. Never cleans his private room or bathroom even if I've told him to. After 2yrs I'm fed up and grossed out. I don't know what to do anymore! **,1
How do I stop this without getting myself blacked balled or dealing with this harassment. TL;DR I broke up with my ex who cheated. I've been getting harassed by ex-girlfriends sister at my job. She holds a lot of weight in the company and her behavior has escalated. How do I stop this without getting myself blacked balled or dealing with this harassment.,1
"Iâ€™m trying to make up for it by doing digital drawings of peopleâ€™s pets. Iâ€™m pretty good at them and itâ€™s very fun to do but I canâ€™t do them fast enough to keep up with the bills. I tried to pick up shifts at the hospital(primary job), but all 8 shifts have been closed due to low census. Iâ€™m still several hundred short for rent and I donâ€™t know what else to do. Everything is due Sunday July 1st.",1
"I always sound like Iâ€™m about to cry. I get really hot and sweaty, my hearing starts to go. I had to stop in a presentation one time last semester to say â€œIâ€™m sorry if I have pretty bad anxiety so if it looks like Iâ€™m about to pass out, please catch meâ€ which was to keep it light and the class did laugh, but it was also a legitimate concern. Does anyone else experience this? Is this what social anxiety is?",1
"I know this goes a bit beyond /r/relationships, but I'm also asking for advice on how to deal with this as far as our relationship is concerned. What do I do?   ---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend's violent, crazy ex-fiance is out of jail after beating up his grandparents, and I don't feel safe. What do I do?",1
"My cats were both inside, but this didn't stop my brain working overtime. I would even listen out to what passers-by were saying, in case they found a dead cat. I would have to get out of bed and look out of the window if I heard a sound that doesn't sound normal, for example a trailer on the back of a car banging. My boyfriend puts on kitten videos to soothe me but all I can think about is 'They are all going to die, how sad is that?' but I don't say anything, I put on my most convincing smile and go along with it.",1
"But now it seems like contact is gonna be forced on me. About two weeks after the breakup, she reached out to tell me she'd gotten an interview at my company. We both work in a pretty specific industry and there was always some overlap with our jobs. Apparently, my company wants to put her company out of business. Recruiters have poached a few folks from her work and I guess she was next on the list.",1
"I felt horrible for her. Ever since, Iâ€™ve been close friends with Corrine. She told me a lot about what happened with her family, and we had a lot of late night conversations where she told me about how she had these nightmares of what mightâ€™ve happened, how she had bits of her brotherâ€™s brain on her shoes afterwards, how she tracked blood through the house while she went to get the phone to call 911. I felt so awful. We were close, but I knew her past was traumatic and rarely pried.",1
"How should I feel after all this? Because I feel like I was used and treated poorly, which she rejects. Also how should I read into her getting annoyed about me being with other girls? If they break up again (this is their 3rd attempt at making their relationship work), should I be there in the same way ago? As much as I like to think I wouldn't I still really love this girl.",1
"Sorry for the ramble, I would like to know if there is any way to contact them? I have my chemistry teachers phone number but I'm not sure if I should go for it. TL;DR too nervous to talk to school counsellor, only counsellor I know is a Chem teacher but it'll be weird to see him in classes. Parents ignorant about mental issues. Can contact Chem teacher but I'm weary.",1
"I was a severe addict that had 2 overdoses when I was younger and addiction/alcoholism runs on both sides of my family. Please tell me the 'hijacking' will stop and I will come back into my own person. I don't want to come out of on the other side and be this nervous and uncomfortable person who is unable to have relationships. I don't drink, or take prescriptions, or smoke. I have been thinking of seeing a therapist, I don't really have the time or extra money, plus I've been really hurt from small intimate AA groups.... Ugh.... Is there another side of this PTSD mental attrition?",1
"I can't get away and sometimes I fear my youngest sibling will suffer for it! I know my mother will force me to never see them again if I make this decision, or even HOW can I make this decision? My only option at this point I feel is to be homeless but that's another can of worms. My thoughts are scattered and I'm honestly scared. I don't know what to do anymore.",1
"Theyâ€™ve only kissed twice but Iâ€™ve read their texts and it seems like he definitely cares a lot about her, enough to share more with her about himself than he ever shared with me. Is it an emotional affair? He assured her he wonâ€™t cut off contact; is he in love with her? What do I next? **",1
"I will be homeless in June and need a place to sleep safely or else I will suffer more severe mental distress, becoming unable to think properly. I went to a shelter organization and the CEO told me they have waaaaaay more homeless than beds (like 50000 homeless and 11000 beds or something like that). While I was there a lady came in to complain about a rape. I involuntarily cry in noisy, busy, crowded environments and become unable to function. How can I help myself best in the leading months?",1
"Hi guys, I have PTSD that came from a suicide related incident. I'm not ready to talk about what happened, but it was pretty recent so even the small things are triggering. This timing couldn't possibly be worse, 13 reasons why is gaining popularity incredibly quickly and the ads are popping up everywhere. I'm getting help, but these things take time and I can't just quit the internet. Is there any way I block that specific type of ad?",1
"But it seems like I'm also dealing with abandonment issues with my parents which has recently reemerged after coming out as transgender which they don't support. Unfortunately, I have Lyme disease and live with them because I'm too sick to do anything and they won't support my transition. I get the feeling that if I was healthy and I transitioned I'd never speak to them. I was reminded of PTSD from a comment on r/raisedbynarcissists/ and Borderline Personality Disorder was brought up. I don't know if it's a secondary condition or overlapping symptoms, but C-PTSD specifically was mentioned and that seems pretty accurate.",1
"I began experiencing ""anxiety attacks"" around 2 weeks ago, and have had 3 since, with the latest one being last night. So the first time I was at the dining hall and all of a sudden all the voices around me began to seem echoey and I had a spike of that warm panicky feeling in my body. I quickly got up to put my plate on the dumbwaiter and left the dining hall and it subsided fairly quickly, I didn't really think much of it. The second time was the following Saturday, where when I got back to my dorm I experienced discomfort/malaise from seemingly nothing, no triggers, nothing, just feeling uncomfortable and anxious. This laster for around 30 minutes.",1
"My finances cover rent and bills. Groceries are a struggle but lately, I've barely been eating so fuck that. I'm just asking for enough to cover getting my car inspected and gas to get there. My life has been slowly falling apart since April of last year and I'm just done. Every morning that i wake up is a disappointment.",1
After a few days I start to try to make plans with her to hang out or go out to eat even if its only for an hour or so. She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no. And this leads to me feeling lonely and unwanted. The part of this that doesn't feel fair is that she can ask to do something with me at anytime and I basically drop everything to go do whatever she wants. I say yes to literally every thing she asks because I just cant help myself not to.,1
"But I mean does it really matter? I didn't know that either but I still felt the same. And he was well aware of what I was going through as much as he could have. Also that whole living situation and that man was horrible and stressful anyway (without it being a trigger for something else too). And I know that if I had been in his position I would have done everything I could to help my partner and taken them seriously, regardless of whether I would have felt that way or as bad about something or not.",1
"My mom noticed and she started screaming at him, and they start having a heated argument. I was not that old at the time, so I didnâ€™t have a cell phone. My mom had one though and it was sitting on the table. E had his in his back pocket and was a little away from me, so I ran and grabbed my momâ€™s phone. I turned my back to him, and tried to dial 911, but before I could E grabbed the phone out of my hand, and put it in his other back pocket.",1
"And it's like that all the time when similar experiences occur. Now this probably has connections to the social anxiety and depression I suffer from (heck I'm feeling anxious rn as I type this) but it's so weird. I mean I guess it kinda makes sense if I'm so insecure, right? Does anyone else suffer from similar forms of anxiety or sort of related? Interested to know.",1
"He has applied for disability but is currently facing waiting two years for an answer (he was denied once before). He tells me he wants to work but is unable to due to the pain he suffers from walking/being on his feet for too long, and a fine he could face from disability for applying for job while applying for disability. He currently has no bank accounts or other means to collect money. He literally only has the clothes that are on his back. I am currently unable to fully support him because I am living across the country from him and am not able to afford to rent him a room (about $500 a month) along with my own expenses and any additional expenses he might need.",1
"My brother and I usually get along but for some reason, he makes me really angry, to the point that I don't like who I become. I'm a pretty level-headed guy and never really yell or get angry at anyone but for some reason **when it comes to my brother the anger I get is so overwhelming**. He's the only one that can get me to that point of anger where I start sweating and shaking. He's never ""hurt"" me in a major way before and all the things that annoy me are little things like ignoring me, not responding to me when I talk to his lack of eye-contact and him generally ignoring/disregarding my attempts of communication. I don't wanna be like this towards him and I don't really know what to do.",1
"Well, the warm season is here which means higher levels of anxiety for me. Thing is, Iâ€™m so used to this pattern that I donâ€™t even care anymore. Iâ€™ve been through the worse of anxiety attacks and now itâ€™s just another â€œoh here we go againâ€ kind of mood. I like the warm weather and whatnot but thereâ€™s too much activity going on since people enjoy going out. I donâ€™t blame them.",1
"Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my main account. For some background, 30 yo male diagnosed with GAD, depression and PTSD. Otherwise healthy, but recently my anxiety has been getting worse and showing itself in the most fucking frustrating way. I'm about a year and a half out of an extremely toxic and abusive relationship. I don't want to go into the details at this point but that relationship shattered my trust in people and, frankly,  myself.",1
Why did I open my mouth I shouldâ€™ve just said â€œIâ€™m fineâ€ ~ I donâ€™t need help Or maybe I do,1

"Dear reddit, For what I am about to tell you today is not a rant from a ""man"", but a voice of a concerned human being who happens to be male. Victims of domestic violence who are men are being laughed at and not taken seriously in today's society. It seems the society has made up their mind that men could not be victims of female violence because the male is ""much bigger"", therefore the male has some kind of ""agenda"" against the female. I was punched and slapped in the face two weeks ago by my wife who is 5'2 103lbs.",1
"I have complex ptsd due to past romantic relationships and some other various traumas in my life. (Also diagnosed bipolar, severe social/general anxiety, OCPD) Currently suffering symptoms that and messing with my healthy thought patterns and its tearing apart my current relationship.

Some monsters are real. I was abused by some as a kid and I was recently reminded that they are still out there. I sometimes manage to find myself in reddit threads with discussions about pedophilia. It bothers me to see people defending pedophila and I often feel the need to respond. I think it seemed a safe way to vent anger at surrogates for my abusers and I think I wanted a chance to say what I never had the chance to say as an abused kid.,1
"Iâ€™m freaking out and I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no resources, my family is worse off then me. And I have to pay for everything on my own including phone and car insurance. Someone help, or help me find someone who can. Thank you so much for reading.",1
"I met my current boyfriend (42M), letâ€™s call him V, back in November. Things were fine, there were no red flags. We dated about a month before one day I went to warm up his coffee for him and he started screaming at me for doing it wrong, and to never do it again. I have PTSD from being raped and abused, and I get uncomfortable when guys yell in the vicinity of me, when they yell at me, itâ€™s debilitating. He knew this as I make it very clear to potential significant others.",1
"My youngest who was 6 at the time had what seemed to be a bladder infection or UTI (urinary tract infection). She was literally peeing every five minutes. Since the doctors office was closed, I took her to the emergency room. Little did I know, my entire world was about to come crashing down. The nurses got us back to a room and once they were done checking her out and had her urine to test, we had to wait for the doctor.",1
"IÂ´m stressing this entire fall break, IÂ´ve been learning for 5 days for about 8-10 hours a day, and I havenÂ´t finished nothing, even after making a schedule (breaks every 45 minutes, dedicating one day to one thing). When I feel stressed, I feel like IÂ´m about to throw up (or IÂ´m about to cry) and I get anxious to the point of total mental breakdown. I have ADHD and stress gets to me really easily, because I canÂ´t keep my attention in place. Any ideas on what to do in this situation?

Why canâ€™t I? Iâ€™d also add my dad was a bush pilot and I work in the travel industry so I know how safe it is. Why canâ€™t I get over it? **Edit** Iâ€™ve rebooked my flight for this morning. I just have to do this.,1
"Public speaking in class frequently reduced me to tears in front of the class and I could think of nothing else for weeks, from the moment it was assigned. Even listening to other people having a conversation is tiring to me, even if I'm not an active participant. As a kid I never wanted to have friends over or go to their houses because a full day of school and being around so many people was exhausting, and that is also true today at work - I just want to go home and be by myself. When I say something stupid or awkward I think about it for weeks and I still berate myself for things that happened in interactions with people ten years ago. Does any of this ring true with those of you with diagnosed SD?",1
"Her parents didn't know about me at this point. I kept this bottled in for a long time, but exploded and was ready to break up with her over it but she said she would stop being in touch with him. She claims he has mental issues and had threatened numerous times to commit suicide. If I take her at her word, there was no sexual contact between them after we started dating. This contributed to me not trusting her.",1
"He came after me a few times so I got away and called cops. He was arrested, restraining order in place and he also had unregistered gun and no licence for them so he may be in trouble for that also. The hard part is he was good to my son, and now he is abruptly gone which is best, but I am not not sure how to explain to him. he is six and very sensitive and the spent a lot of time together. tl;dr boyfriend got aggressive and is jailed, how to tell young son why bf is gone now and we have to move soon?",1

"So I drank wine and I started crying and since my husband was constantly telling me that I ruined his life and he regrets being married to me and I'm the devil and blah blah, for the first time in my life I picked up the knife and I thought I should just kill my self. When my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said I am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide. He kicked me and spat on me. I kept on try to explain to him that I can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie. I tried telling him I am trying to fix myself.",1
"Broken bones, concussion. He broke my glasses in half, destroyed my TV and dvd player. He tore my clothes off but luckily didn't rape me.

She doesn't pay for my tuition yet constantly puts me down by calling me dumb. Anyone have any tips on how to survive the next week? So far I've been playing super loud music in my headphones whenever she tries to come up and say something to me but I'm looking for options that are less likely to end up in my going deaf haha. Any tips for how I can quickly forge a future without her in my life would be helpful too. I'm in my third year of college and am hoping to have a job after I graduate but at the moment I feel so chained down to her.,1
"I blame myself. Almost all the time. Especially when I feel bad, I see the uncomfortable feelings as wrong in the first place, and that it's my fault that I feel bad. This makes me feel worse. When I feel worse because I hate myself, I hate myself for hating myself for feeling bad.",1

"I think it was last year, we could hear the little girl crying out so loud inside their home, we called the cops. This is just a rumor, but our next-door neighbors say that the house is actually under police watch, and that they're drug dealers.

Been on Lexapro for panic attacks and social anxiety for 6 months. Got all the bad side effects of Lexapro and it made me have a few moments of almost going ""insane"".

Anyone have stories of switching off Lexapro to something else that made them less anxious and more confident?",1
"I would like to have a relationship with his parents in the very least and let them actually get to know me, but he really doesn't want to introduce me to them.

"Hi r/anxiety, So lately my anxiety/hypochondria has been through the roof. I convince myself that I have all of these symptoms and then my body actually feels like it produces them.

I donâ€™t remember a lot of it I just remember little snip bits of what happened. I donâ€™t even remember if there was penetration and Iâ€™m hoping there wasnâ€™t. I still have problems trying to remember what happened and I feel like if I remember it all Iâ€™m going to have a breakdown. Now that Iâ€™m older Iâ€™m starting to have sex and be intimate with others.

My mother has stage 4 bile duct cancer and it seems like her time is limited. She has a $5k insurance policy but I know that's not going to be enough. I've had to take a lot of time off work to take care of her and I just don't have the money to pay for what the insurance won't cover. What are some resources I can use to help pay for this?

"He kept holding my arm while talking to me. He kept saying how beautiful I was. Even after he finished the exam he did another sweep with his hand idk wtf he was checking because we were all done Iâ€™m almost positive he just wanted to fucking touch me because every chance he could he would.

"I have been having anxiety sense I was 16, I'm now 20. This 4 years have been difficult, lots of ups and downs, on and off medication and therapy (never really had more then just 3 appointments with the same professional ever).

"I e-mailed him a few times and received no response from him when I really needed one. Because of his lack of response, I was forced to drop out of school, University of [State (Go Mascots!! )], and I could not finish the quarter and now owe them much more money than before. But it is NOT entirely his fault. Yes I resent him at times, but I could have just as easily approached him about the subject and gotten everything taken care of, but my anxiety hadn't made me comfortable around them, so I couldn't bring my self to do it.",1
"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories. And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and thatâ€™s even more isolating.

"She then said to me ""Am I not worth the effort because you don't want to fix this?"" after I told her I did not want to see her. There is plenty of other passive aggressive stuff that she says, but right now I'm so blinded by my disbelief I can't even tell if she is just being emotional or manipulative. What bothers me is this behavior happens every time we have gotten into a fight and then I have to apologize and make it right. tl;dr: Got into a fight with gf of 2 years since highschool - I've hit my breaking point.",1
"The problem is is that the kinds of mistakes I have made are the ones I can't even fix, because I won't be on shift to. I don't know what to say to be helpful, and to diffuse tensions.

I'm quitting my job in a couple of months but right now I don't feel great. I should work out a bit to feel better. I know that there isn't much to do but I needed to write it somewhere.

She has called 211 and has tried to speak with someone from a local shelter called Mercy house but they haven't gotten back to her.,1
That completely threw me. I don't know why I'm finding it so difficult to cope. I'm crying frequently for some reason and I don't know why. I haven't done the whole uncontrollable crying thing since my last episode which was all the way back in November 2016. (I spent 2017 learning to shut down my emotions so crying had become a thing of the past.),1
I dread what it would be like to inject myself with insulin. I am out of work due to a lot of health problems I have chronicled on Reddit.

"I've suffered from a mild anxiety disorder w/ depression (diagnosed) for about 4 years, all while I've been with my (now) DH. DH is logical/rational to a fault, and while generally supportive, cannot understand how I feel and act when depressed, or suffering from particularly bad anxiety. No matter how I try to explain to him, tell him that I literally cannot help it or just magically lift myself out of it, he insists that I'm being ""dramatic"". It makes me feel all the more vulnerable, and all the more difficult to speak for myself. What advise/experience do you have for helping someone understand who has never experienced depression and/or anxiety that the disorder is ""real"" and not in active control of the victim?",1
I have no friends. This has been both a cause and an effect of my anxiety and depression. I can open up and become confident once I get to know people and I have had friends before but I've gone almost a whole year with no actual friends since I have moved. Moving and the effects it had has greatly affected my confidence making new friends since I most of my interactions are with small town people who have had their friends and known other groups for years.

"Has anyone else gone through this? Iâ€™ve dealt with anxiety for 7+ years, depending on what you mark as the origin of it, and in the past several years Iâ€™ve tried every non-medical solution google came up with/my wallet allowed. Iâ€™ve thought very long and hard about seeking medical help for my anxiety, and finally did this week. Honestly, there was a lot of support and encouragement to seek treatment from people I talked to about it previously. The doctor I saw was amazingâ€”seriously I had no idea how to broach the topic and I felt 100% comfortable discussing my concerns from the moment I opened my mouth until I left the office.",1
"I'm obsessing over my new relationship also. Like... its starting out, and I can't get clear from him what he thinks of us etc. I haven't heard from him all day, I'm thinking at this point he may have left his phone at home or something on accident.

"I used to be a very touchy feely person pre trauma, hell I'd have stood out in a big city with a sign for free hugs, I *wanted* to. I'd touch a leg for sympathy, throw an arm around shoulders for comradeship. My family was never like that growing up. Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate. The latter is still true but I make it a joke.",1
"Even as Iâ€™m cooking, heâ€™s still screaming in my face, telling me that Iâ€™m done at my job and I need to quit now.

Hello r/Assistance. I want to go to rehab for my cocaine addiction I live in the USA where rehab has a bad stigma sadly.

"Especially always being tired which just adds to the anxiety. I'm having some trouble falling asleep atm (and staying asleep which is even worse) and thought that maybe typing my thoughts out would help relax my mind and help me see my problems from a different perspective.

I went to see a counselor in college and he thought if I got more of a routine going I would be fine, he also was extremely judgemental and scolded me for not coming into college regularly, he didn't believe me things I told him, so I left. I did go to a counselor about 12 times after the abusive relationship ended, I still felt vulnerable and scared leaving it that place and told her I don't feel ready to stop this. She said there was nothing more she could do. Now I am at the point where I feel like there is nothing nobody can do for me, I feel emotionally trapped and I don't know what to do, or where to go anymore.",1
I canâ€™t have fun anymore. I canâ€™t enjoy life anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. This is hopeless. I had to come home from work because I canâ€™t stop crying.,1
"Is this the way our state agencies treat the elderly and disabled? Obviously so, because they're doing to ME!!! and to others. I have brought this up no less than 4 times to my case worker **name removed** from adult protective services and she just ignores it and keeps telling me she will ""look into it"" and does nothing about it. I am now starting to breakout in skin rashes due to having to wear filthy dirty clothing.",1
"I feel so worthless on those days. I guess I just needed to vent to a community that will hopefully understand, and see if anyone else had any similar experiences. I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year. PTSD often = dp/dr, benzos often = dp/dr, and benzo withdrawal (which many helpful internet sites say can last months or even years, yay) often = dp/dr. What in the fuck have I done to myself?",1
"On top of that, I also haven't taken the ACT, because I didn't think I'd even consider college. I literally feel like I know nothing and am completely unprepared for the ACT no matter how much I study, because I never payed attention in my classes. More things stressing me out are politics and family. But, not as much as the school / job thing. And I haven't reached out to anyone to tell them how stressed I am, and I feel it seems so stupid, and I'm sorry.",1
"We get no child support and are doing well financially without it and although he is supposed to pay, I leave it alone because he leaves us alone. Long story short, I didn't file or ask for supervised visitation, but that's what the courts ordered. He did that two or three times within a year and haven't heard from him since. This Friday for the first time in years I realized how much my life has changed and how happy I and my children are. Then, of course, I get the curve ball of this message on Saturday evening.",1
"Some context: I manage a person who is young (late twenties, but when angry acts like a toddler throwing a tantrum), who is a gaslighting bully. She's well-connected at my workplace, so gets lots of support from her ""friends"" who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her ""version"" of situations. This is problematic, because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff, customers, and myself, but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum. She presents herself as friendly and sympathetic - often the ""victim"" of the situation - so people believe her. I suffer from anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression, so this is a nightmare for me.",1
"It's important that people know this when they claim platitudes about 'getting support' and 'healing' that require a stable home, friends, family or even relationships. I spent all of that time trying to get to this point by myself just so some selfish POS could slap me down again. I hate this. I posted this on twitter because I couldn't think and I just wanted to share something even anonymously, of course I got nothing. It's hard to admit sometimes, until you're desperate, but I wanted someone to care.",1
"Again, I worry they'll say that if I'm sexually active, I should be able to do this just fine. -Could I get them to only not leave the room or open the door where someone walking by could see me? -Could I ask them to tell me everything as they're doing it? So I'm somewhat prepared for everything? -Could I get them to stop if I need it?",1
He would call me by the name peepee until I was 21. I asked him to stop but he just yells at me. I wish he would die or never talk to me. He also forces me to take medication because I got mad at him because of this. He will just scream at me and threaten to call the police to throw me on the street or something.,1
"I'm sure that there are many people worse off than me in this kind of situation but I just can't stand this feeling anymore. I just want someone to choose me for once, instead of just being stuck with me. Unfortunately, I have no idea how this could happen.   --- TL;DR I don't want to feel lonely anymore but I have no idea how to fix myself.",1
"But if I want to be successful at networking and forming close friendships/relationships, I need to get rid of this phobia somehow. In some ways, my fear is interfering with not just my social life, but my academics as well. I earn high grades but if I want to snatch opportunities outside of the classroom, I need to suck it up and try to tolerate group work with my classmates more. I opened up to a therapist about this, but before we could actually discuss ways on how to combat the problem, she ended up leaving. How does one go about becoming more comfortable around men?",1
"I would appreciate any insight from other ppl with ptsd and flashbacks. My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened. It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why heâ€™s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks? And what kind of things would be most helpful for your partner to do to help you back up to the present?",1
"My sister is a shift worker - works around the clock at ridiculous times. I asked her (before I moved in) if she could sometimes pick me up from work if I worked late and if she could help me with my driving - she said yes. I've now asked a her a few times if we could drive somewhere she has said: ""no"", ""just because"", and ""I'm sick and tired"". She's lazy and selfish. I've asked her once if she could pick me up from work (as my dad was unavailable) knowing for a fact she's not working and I get a response saying ""I'll pick you up at the bus stop down the road"" - which doesn't help me at all.",1
"My father is an alcoholic, and he has been for about 34 years. My mom has had to deal with this the entire time, and lately, he has been having parties at their house and drinking up until 3-4am almost every weekend. He drinks everyday, and my mother usually comes to me to vent about it. Iâ€™ve honestly lost my patience because I feel she should do something about it, but she wonâ€™t. Sheâ€™s afraid to leave because he says heâ€™ll accuse her of abandoning the home.",1
I have no assets to sell outside of a broken android phone and have no family to ask for help from. I am about $150 short right now and have had to skip appointments to save money. My landlord has a quick temper and is not often understanding of late payments. I am on a month-to-month lease and am very afraid that I will lose my apartment. I have work prospects that should become viable within the next couple of weeks but I really need help to get to that point.,1
"Hardly any jobs there too. So maybe even the next town over is the only place age could find a job. I have a car, not very reliable car, at that. So she has a place to stay until she gets on her feet but no transportation. No licence to trek that 20 miles back and forth up and down the mountain even if she did get a job.",1
"I don't know why, because it didn't bother me before I actually saw it on a screen, but I am absolutely crushed. I've asked him to hide it from me from now on and expressed how hurt it was, but I went to use his gaming system a couple of days ago and saw he was still looking it up regularly (I guess he thought I wouldn't use it - I had gone to look up something and all the searches popped up in the Bing bar). I never felt attractive to him and I know that's my own fault and insecurity and not his problem to fix. I know rationally that men like variety. But I haven't sent him nudes in probably two months now.",1
"During my break at work today, a little over two hours ago, I was enjoying a cup of grape juice. At one moment I started drinking it too fast, and choked and coughed for a few moments. Then i was constantly burping and had the taste of grape juice in my mouth for the next hour after that. Lol. But thanks to my anxiety, I have managed to convince myself juice got in my lungs and I'm gonna get ""Dry/Secondary Drowning""...",1
I am constantly afraid of when it's going to happen next and I'm so scared I'm going to have some embarrassing reaction to it. It happened today and I was able to play it cool for about 5 minutes and then I went on my lunch and cried my eyes out in my car. I've been having really bad flashbacks all afternoon and night. I really wish it didn't get to me like this. My day was seriously ruined by a harmless prank.,1
"  I am a 30 year old male with a 5 lb dog recently homeless in Washington state. My dog is the last remaining thing from when life was normal,  and I refuse to get ride of her after being my companion for 6 years.

I was assigned less hours than the high schoolers I worked with  (3-4 hour shifts)I was unable to maintain the apartment. I do not have any drug abuse problems or alcohol.",1
Obviously they don't care but to me it means everything. I've always been like this. My dream one day is just to magically wake up with this skill.. if only like worked like that.. Does anyone have any tips on how to calm my anxiety down and not let it overpower me? Anything would be greatly appreciated.,1
"I know the best thing for me is to find a new job, but I've been applying for quite awhile now with no luck and I really don't want to move to another job that I don't enjoy and will make me feel the exact same way. I sort of think I have an idea of what I want to do, but I have no idea how to make it happen while still paying my bills so I've been applying to anything that seems like it might be relevant to me, but I'm not sure the right way to go about getting into a field I don't have a degree in. Because of this I feel trapped in my job right now and it gets so bad some days where I feel like just walking out and quitting or just not going in ever again. I'm rambling at this point, does anyone else deal with a job that makes them completely miserable? How do you deal with it?",1
"I need to borrow $60, I was in the hospital earlier this week and missed a shift so I'm going to be short my next check, and I'm already down to only $20. I can pay back $85 by december 14th &#x200B; I've paid back $100 in here before, and I've also posted to /r/borrow already. If you can help I'd really appreciate it, I can provide documentation of being in the hospital and my job",1
"The problem occurs when he returns to visit me for 1-2 weeks. When he's back at his girlfriend's house, he doesn't really have much to do. So, he spends a lot of time gambling. That in itself is a gigantic problem since we have almost no money. He is gambling money that he **can't afford to lose**.",1
"I paid off some of my credit card debt a couple days ago, but my company also charged me on their automatic pay system. I barely had enough this paycheck to cover just the single payment; when this extra payment processes it's going to cost me an overdraft fee. I am in no position to let that happen and so I need money to cover for it, as well as cover for my student loan payment which also hasn't processed yet. I need somewhere around $50 to completely clear me out of any sort of financial trouble. I can use Paypal or Google Wallet, whichever works best.",1
I was completely on my own by 14. When she felt the cuts on my wrists in the dark on night she asked if I was cutting ? I said no and she never said anything again. I could go on and on. I think she truly believes that because I am an adult now that all the screw ups all the pain I have been through is my own fault.,1
"i probably havesevere gad. at least i think i do. i need to get help because im avoiding anything i can. school starts again in a few weeks, and im an upcoming sophmore. i want to stop skipping lunch because all of the people in there make me anxious and i cant bring myself to look up i stare at the ground 99% of the time whenever i walk through the halls because i cant stand to make eye contact.",1
"How did you come up with it? I've wanted to kill myself almost everyday for 17 years. I'm done talking to therapists and asking friends for help. Right now I see two options: commit suicide or develop an emergency self-care plan for when I'm feeling this way so I'll be okay until I feel safe again. Unfortunately, my meds only impact anxiety (and only sometimes), not depression or PTSD.",1
"I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth. The worst thing is, I can't bring myself to talk to anybody. I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor. I felt like I could get through it on my own. Even now, its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.",1
"She gives me something weaker that I know will NOT work. I've been on so many meds, I feel like I'm at the point where I know what will work and what won't and she might as well written me a script for a sugar pill. This is what she decides to do after I tell her how anxious I am, how a heavy duty benzo isn't working and how I'm near the brink of ending my life due to fear and anxiety and have no options left. Do I blame her for being cautious? No.",1
I realized he is not very nice or smart and totally unwilling to cooperate/compromise. I wanted to leave but he had spent all my money (promising to give it back haha) and I had nowhere to go. I had the baby (he went out to eat with his mother while I was in unmedicated labor). Basically I made one stupid mistake after another and let him walk all over me and it doesn't stop there. I took care of the baby all by myself for 6 months.,1
"I tried to break up with him at the end of the semester the day he was supposed to leave but he intentionally missed his flight to stay talking to me and talk me into staying with him. I don't know what to do. Mostly, I am scared that I will deal some kind of huge blow to his mental health and am just very scared of the repurcussions. I have friends apart from him I feel like I can fall back on, but I feel like a monster for confirming his fear of abandonment. I also feel conflicted because he is incredibly kind and generous and affectionate",1
"I'm new to this so please forgive me. I'm not very good at expressing my emotions. I need advice/help. I was molested multiple times by my biological dad when I was 5 up until middle school (so like 10 yrs old). After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1
He denied it and ever since then I think everyone is out to get me and that nothing ever happened and I'm just insane. I always doubt myself and it's hard to hang out with anyone because I think they all have some agenda toward me. I know logically nothing happened but when I get home I have to always check my body for bruises or anything suspicious. Then I feel shameful and want to self harm/die when I realize I'm accusing someone innocent of something so terrible and then my mind tells me nothing ever happened and I'm just nuts. It doesn't help that my family doesn't understand me and minimalizes all of my problems.,1
"I have been living in <location> at a homeless shelter run by the Salvation Army since the beginning of February (I know it hasn't been that long but still), and I started a new job a month or so later around the beginning of March. I don't know if my boss did a google search of the address I have on record or maybe drove past it one day, but I overheard him talking to another one of the staff about how 'the homeless population here in Toronto is getting pretty bad, and how there might be a lot once the weather improves because of the people trying to leave the USA because of Trump' And since I heard this conversation, I went from having 3 shifts of 4 hours per week (12 hours per week), down to this week I have 1 shift that's only 3 hours, and he's blaming how our sales are really slow, which they are down by an average of 4% compared to last year according to the reports that are printed automatically each day. It also doesn't help that since I started a month ago, we had 11 employees and as of this morning we now have 16. Tell me why the hell if business is so slow, why did we increase the number of staff by almost 50%?",1
"She also told me that I was an idiot for wasting my life, or attempting to end it anyways. I came out of that appointment in tears. That was a horrible day and I still think about it. It made me feel like I had nothing to complain about. Its only taken me until the last couple of weeks to finally accept that I did nothing wrong.",1
"Also, as of right now, the 2017 team is on their trek to Alaska. Because of this, I'm limited on what I can do to raise money, since the main focus is on them. In the meantime, all I can do is ask for donations. I was hoping Reddit could help me out with this. If anyone wants to donate to me personally, here's the link to do so, along with my reason for riding: <url>",1
"Am I being way overdramatic? Hope I provided enough information. I truly tried not to sound angry or overly upset.   ---   **tl;dr**: My mother has hit me quite a few times, put my clothes in trash bags when I don't clean them on time, won't let me lock my door, and has threatened to take away the car I drive that they paid for (and therefore job and access to classes).",1
"Iâ€™m high risk for PPD seeing as I have preexisting BPD and anxiety, and going back into working immediately after giving birth would most likely be very damaging. Not to mention I havenâ€™t had the easiest pregnancy, having had multiple emergency room stays and having been hospitalized.

Even $5 is a huge help, because that's $5 less that we'll have to borrow to cover our bills while I'm not working. <url>",1

Iâ€™m expected to be around them 24/7 and when theyâ€™re all losing their shit, all I want to do is crawl into a hole and hide away. Iâ€™m constantly on edge because Iâ€™m constantly being startled or scared, thereâ€™s a lot of yelling and screaming and crying, and itâ€™s only the end of day 3 of a two week vacation.

I am constantly freaking out and unable to see friends that don't know about my diagnosis or make the friends that do feel very uncomfortable. I feel guilty because I feel as if I brought this all on myself because if I hadn't of taunted my father he would not have attacked me.

"After burning out, I fumbled through a tough, 8-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps. I then went back to college and  obtained an Associates Degree with a 4.0 GPA, before burning out just shy of a Bachelors. Following that, by leveraging my limited IT experience from the Marine Corps,  I landed a job averaging $110k annually with a Fortune 500 company. Along the way I got married, and my wife and I now have four, brilliant children. Three years since burning up (again) and walking away from the $110k job, life continues to go completely down hill.",1
"Background: This time last year I lost my job, got evicted and my car broke down all in the same month. Cut to today and I found out my site is closing and we'll all soon be out of the job.

"I just got a small job offer from a friend of mine who works prepping dessert plates at a restaurant, and well I agreed to try it out but I feel so anxious. This happens every time I look for jobs and they actually want to hear of me. I donâ€™t know why, the whole process just feels like my embarrassment on display and Iâ€™m afraid to commit myself to working part time due to this. Itâ€™s nothing hard yet I feel so ashamed when I tell my family and partner that I didnâ€™t simply like the job or feel like itâ€™s demanding too much of me atm. Itâ€™s like getting a job takes so much from me atleast socially.",1
Hello all I am about to be laid off. I am currently on a prepaid cell phone plan. I use this basic smartphone for all extra side money and internet. I can barely pay the bill this month but the device is not working well at all as it is old and I spilled a good amount of water on it last night during dinner.,1
I've been thinking about this for weeks and have talked about it with her on numeral occasions and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I just don't know what to feel right now and I'm an emotional wreck. Am I overthinking or it are these reasonable things to worry about?   ---   **tl;dr**: worried what people will say about my girlfriend and I.,1
"I called my boyfriend, and I just ranted at him. He was shocked. I've never spoken like that about anyone. I wasn't even thinking about what was coming out of my mouth, and I just called her all these names and said all these horrible things about her when she isn't a bad person! How the hell do I get over this?",1
I'm so scared I actually don't want to lose him. I love him. I love him so much. tl;dr: I've gotten gaslighted in my past relationships and it's caused me to have a lot of self doubt about my thoughts and feelings and question myself constantly. in this case I'm questioning if im actually losing feelings since I'm developing crushes on others.,1

I am going to be a college drop-out in my 3rd year due to family reason instead of academics. After a lot of research, I am contemplating between Wichita, Kansas and Columbus, Ohio. I really just want a minimum wage job where I can have a bed and private bathroom. Afterward I can get my life together and start taking programming jobs again.",1
"That was easy, I was probably anxious about my health because I lost a very close relative when I was 11. The second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. Checking my records of doctor visits, I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.",1
"I endured months and months of all types of abuse, the final time was when he grabbed an iron gym equipment that you attach to the wall and threatened to hit my pregant stomach with it. After all of this, after denying my child, saying he wasnt the father, after taking everything he had from me, i missed an important detail: A witness stood quiet. To this day, I think heavily of this, and I fear that karma will get them both (heavens forbid) through the child. Please.",1
"I can't find an affordable place to rent that would fit in with my budget and I have no savings. I've looked up a lot of the shelters around me that give out meals/ have assistance, but they all close before I get out of work so I can't even drive over and ask questions. I can't call during work because I work in a very customer-centric work environment. So I guess my questions are: What should I be looking out for when living in my car? How do I go NC with my dad but still keep in contact with my family?",1
"I'm 29 and I've just committed to moving into a shared apartment in my city centre. I've never lived in a place like this before because it's an en-suite with my own double bedroom and bathroom, but the kitchen and lounge is shared with about 15 other 'profressionals' It's right in the centre of a bustling city near all the bars and music venues. I've always lived in the suburbs but I've always felt a bit disconnected from everything because most of my (limited) social life takes place in the city centre. But now I'm scared because I'm such an introvert and there's going to be lots of people around all the time and I'm worried I've made a mistake. Another big worry of mine is that my ex best friend lives just a few streets away from where I will be living and we are going to be sharing the same supermarket etc.",1
"I grew up my countryâ€™s equivalent of the bible belt. My country is well known for being very very progressive in our larger cities, and very very conservative in our villages â€“ this is true I think for most countries, but the sheer difference between our â€œlevelsâ€ is pretty well known. I grew up in an abusive household, surrounded by really misogynist men, and have experienced trauma on both these fronts. This obviously caused me some mental health issues. I was afraid of, and uncomfortable around, men for a very long time.",1
"I've put him up in a motel for a few days, bought him a bike, and gave him some money, but I know I can't afford to have him stay at a motel forever (or even support him like that! ), the money will run out, and I just feel sick/stressed/sad because I don't even know what to do at this point or how to help anymore than what I've already done. I work full time and have to suppport myself and I live at home with my mother and she wants absolutely nothing to do with him. He needs help and I just don't what else I can do. Any advice or resources would be much appreciated!",1
"Two days ago I packed all of my clothes into my car and have started living out of it. I sleep in the parking lot at work, work for 8 hours, and then spend the day at Starbucks on the internet and charging my electronics. Once Thursday rolls around I will have ~$400, which is not much as far as being able to afford a place to sleep. If I become good at living out of my car over the next few days, I may just use some of that money to invest in making it easier for myself. I don't really know why I'm posting this here, except that living out of your car is a pretty lonely experience.",1
It honestly felt like someone punched a hole right through me. Later in the day I texted her and we talked. I asked her how the trip went. She sounded exited to talk to me and it sounded like it would work out between us. I asked her abut her friend and if anything had happened between them and she said that nothing had happened and that her aunt was with her the whole time.,1
"Basically Iâ€™m going through quite a bit right now. I suffer from anxiety, depression probably (low mood, irritation, poor concentration) and things just havenâ€™t been going that well. My friend who has autism makes off-the-wall jokes about death and killing in general. That bothers me as two of my friends have passed away in their 20sâ€¦ And I still think about them and try to remember the good times. Suffering from The Doubting Disease has been fun.",1
"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted when I was 18, but to be honest I've never really felt like I had it. I can usually push things down so deeply that I don't feel many repercussions of what I've been through aside from a lot of shame. In the last 4 months though, someone who's been on and off harassing me since I was 17 has resurfaced. He was sending me hundreds of texts and calling me saying things varying from ""you're going to marry me and we can have kids and live together forever"" to ""you're a whore and you're a disgusting person and I want to (insert threat) you"". He makes fake accounts and tries to add me or adds my friends accusing them of taking me from him.",1
"Our family cat Bootsy became very ill and we took her to the vet. We spent what little money we had on diagnostics there and after an ultrasound it was determined she would need surgery immediately or she would likely die. We didn't have the money for surgery but found an organization which would perform the procedure and provide necessary care to help her if we transferred ownership. We gave Bootsy up to have a chance of saving her life. After some weeks of care and a surgery, we recently found out Bootsy fully recovered, but the organization will not return her to us unless we pay for a portion of the cost of her care, approximately $650.",1
I was also forced (with threat of prison time) to get asleep apnea test. Fastest response from the VA Iâ€™ve ever seen. Within 36 hours I was diagnosed and set up with a CPAP machine. Matches up with my ex-wifeâ€™s thoughts that I donâ€™t sleep more than 30 min before coughing myself awake and throwing fists. Burn pits fucking suck.,1
"-I don't have any relief in my symptoms and am concerned that I've wasted an entire year of my life I'm concerned that I not leave this relationship too soon, but at the same time, I'm paying for this therapy, I have repeatedly brought up questions about goals in my sessions, and don't feel like this is the right fit...unless I need to open up more. I chose her initially because she was covered by my insurance less because I felt like she was the right match. Do I stick this out? I have started to fantasize about having a new therapist, because then I could start over and feel heard.",1
He went on rant (not aggressive) about how he worked all 50 something year's for the stuff he has and how everyone want to just thrown it away. And at that point I feeling like a gave up (it being 6 yrs to this day since I've graduated High school and grasped an idea). I currently want nothing from him. I still love my father and would do for him as he is still my dad but I don't trust him at all!! I did not mention the fact that he'll go through the garbage to see what me and my mother thrown out.,1
Now I want to drink till I'm drunk again and my head sounds as though there is yelling when I'm the only one home. Hmm...fun times. At least I have a drs appointment coming up soon so I can bring it up. Still. These moments suck.,1
"There is a time difference and he's busy! don't worry about it winteryokohama"" but there is also crazy brain that is thinking, ""This is him trying to never talk to me again and end things."" I am driving myself crazy and I'm sick of it. I am NOT spamming him with texts, i am giving him space, and trying to let him enjoy his trip! What are your thoughts reddit?",1
"to complicate things, we live in cities that are hours away from each other and i just wrecked my car. the helplines i keep getting referred to have been useless so far. i'm staying with extended family and have no support relationship-wise from either them or friends because we're all dead broke. i do have a job but i'm having to pay expensive uber fare just to get there as its a while away. i just got the news about this yesterday so i'm frantically searching for answers.",1
And November. And then two weeks ago which resulted in heavy head bruising and another concussion that lasted all of the two weeks. He kneed me repeatedly on the head and kicked me in the face as well as punched me several times. I tried to escape. I tried to get away.,1
"They threw me up against the wall, patted me down and told me to sit down outside. The first agent ran in making quick tactical turns around the corners and in the rooms with his gun out. I asked one of the cops what was going on a few times before the words ""Child Pornography"" dropped out of his mouth like a fucking anvil in my gut. I didn't say anything, I could not comprehend that it was really happening. I've been through some shit in my life but I've never experienced the level of total bewilderment and unreality that I did when I realized the FBIs Crimes Against Children unit was raiding me for kiddie porn.",1
"He has since gained back about three pounds, but he is still a far shot from what he used to be. He's going into the procedure tomorrow. The total cost is 1150 dollars, and to be honest, I'm a poor college student. The procedure will be put on a credit card, and I probably won't be paying it off for a long time. Blackie has been my cat for the last ten years, and without this treatment there is a good chance he will not make it past summer.",1
"I am not sad, I am not depressed, I am still a very happy and optimistic person with a great life, good friends, family, job, all that. But I am struggling to manage this anxiety because it spills into life. I don't have thoughts I obsess over, I don't worry about anything really. It's just the stress I have been through set up my body for this crap response. Besides relaxation, meditation and such, what can you recommend?",1
"It was more calm then I had felt in months. But then I remembered, scars. That has stopped me since those three days of calm. I only have few scratches and cuts and one glass cut but I easily hide them with a few wristbands and a watch. Thing is, everything scars and if I keep going, its going to affect me later in life.",1
"I meant this stuff, and I think I still sort of do. The reason I've been so angry recently is just the general stuff with my family, but also my dad specifically. He's been awful to me in the past couple of days, everything I say or do no matter how good I'm trying to be is bad and horrible and stupid, and if I disagree with him even slightly he gets angry. But I think I might deserve it. I feel like a bad person.",1
"He said that I should have ptsd because the reason I was wrestling my dad for the gun is because Im a sick bastard who wanted to kill him and the rest of my family. I don't know why I made this post. I don't know if I even really got out what I wanted to say. I just feel so alone. Its been almost a year since that day but even today , my family some how twisted my actions into thinking im some sort of failed murderer",1
"I have no one to relate with, and if I can't get around it, I'll be eventually separated because I can't afford to fail another PFT because of it. I'm not here for sympathy about what lead to my anxiety. I want to put that out there. And I'm not sorry if anyone gets offended by my dark sense of humor. That's the only way I've found temporarily deal with it.",1
"I just feel so naked and unprotected. WIll this be any different with the therapist? After all I don't even know if I want to go to this therapy session, I'm so confused about myself it's unbelievable. Has anyone of you guys ever experienced this self-confusion before and can help me finding myself again? The appointment has not even yet been made and I'm already freakin' out about it, I feel kinda like an idiot right now.",1

Would really appreciate any help so i could feed myself the upcoming time, not sure if i can offer much in return except my utmost gratitude (Though tell me if you need anything and i might be able to help).

"I constantly face so much anxiety in school. It makes me extremely depressed, and itâ€™s just hard to cope with. I donâ€™t know if anxiety/depression have anything to do with memory performance, but Iâ€™ve noticed that I remember a lot less compared to when I wasnâ€™t in a depressed and anxious state. For hours on end I contemplate and procrastinate everyday about my depressing life. Itâ€™s just sad.",1
"I had two friends attempt (no longer friends because one was a narcissist and the other was an abusive borderline) and both those attempts traumatized me. They made me so upset. I also was upset about the fake accusation about talking about rape porn. I keep thinking about my assault.

"I don't know. I keep overthinking everything and I am worrying about what it would be like to be with him for an extended amount of time. What if it is horrible and we end up hating each other? I fear that I cannot deliver what he wants and deserves emotionally and sexually, and those fears stunt my ability to love him freely. I am wary of the fact I have no control over the outcome of that.",1

On Facebook a lot of my friends are celebrating their own or their kidsâ€™ birthdays today, their wedding anniversaries, sharing memories of the awesome vacations they were on on this day last year, etc. I feel weird and alone in my trauma. Itâ€™s not that I want anyone to have to join me in misery, but I guess Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else out there happens to be dealing with this at the same time as me.",1

You guys were recommended by the super supportive guys over at r/twoXchromosomes where I made this post earlier in the week: <url> (tl;dr: I've been facing a lot of personal strife lately, argument on Saturday with my husband resulted in restraining and a hit to the face. We're both military members.) A few things have happened since last Saturday.",1
"I, too, am loyal to her. My insecurity came out pretty early in our relationship. I was still getting to know her and there was a lot to figure out. It's normal to be insecure in a new relationship, but the problem is that I can't stop being insecure. I feel like my insecurities spiraled out of control and now she is thinking of leaving me.",1
I need to start setting some healthy boundaries and cut these people out of my life. I just do not know where to start because they are family but I have three girls that are growing. I cannot have them involved with these monsters. My children will know a different world. Do I tell my father or just fade slowly into the abyss and never look back?,1
"Every once and a while I will get this over whelming feeling in my head where I feel really out of it, and freaked out. I will feel like I havenâ€™t slept in a bit, I donâ€™t feel like me. Iâ€™m anxious but also tired and I wanna just go take a nap. But my inner self tells me that I am going to have a seizure. I donâ€™t have seizures or anything and I am completely healthy.",1
"I think about it very often, wondering if I should just do it, get it over with, but something keeps holding me back. I wonder if this was my fault, that I would be turned away for not bringing it to their attention earlier, if I would be accused of participating, I keep wondering if theyâ€™ll believe an 18 year old or a 40 year old. Please, if anyone who is struggling reads this, please donâ€™t let yourself fall into this trap. Donâ€™t keep your mouth closed, donâ€™t be polite, keep yourself safe no matter what that costs.

"At this point I've moved home (living with 4 younger siblings and 2 loud dogs), and I finally started a new job. I'm seeing a new psychologist and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist. My new doctor has seen me twice and already changed my diagnosis I to PTSD, which not only fits all of my symptoms, but includes some that I thought were just part of my personality. But since hearing this, I've really been struggling with accepting the reality that I have to deal with. I have vivid and disturbing nightmares, I wake up soaked in sweat, freezing and crying.",1

"This leads to me not liking the general mood in the classroom which leads to me being un-motivated and demoralised when I'm at school. Every day I try to see if I can pretend to be sick to avoid going to school because I find almost no joy at school which is a shame, because of all the schools I have been to over the years, i actually enjoy what we do and the teachers are nice. I have no idea why this simple fact is affecting me so much. But I just feel horrible whenever I think about school or the thought of having to go to school. TL;DR: I spent a lot of time with my friends during break, and I'm depressed because I have to go back to school with classmates that are very immature.",1

"Some times it feels like my dreams will never go away. I have regular dreams about my ex. Usually a few dreams every week. Sometimes the dreams quiet down and some times they occur every night. He was abusive to the point where he tried to kill me while I was laying in bed one night, and he was very physically abuse  every other day.",1
"So, to start with I have ptsd from years of emotional/mental/verbal abuse and a few years of physical abuse/sexual assault. I have problems because of this obviously. My soon to be MIL just learned that I have PTSD from my fiancÃ©. In order to keep it to something sheâ€™d understand, because when she thinks one thing itâ€™s too hard to change her mind or get her to understand, he changed the story a little before he talked to her as well leaving some stuff out. However, he told her about me having been dating someone when I was sexually assaulted and changed the story to say I went over there while dating someone else and it happened.",1
"It was worse than that, I wanted to throw up, not because I found the scars disgusting but because the person I loved so so much, had done that to herself. This is when she told me more about her situation, basically all her issues is beacause of a very unstable family with an alcoholic, mentally abusive and neglective father. Her mom is her best friend in the world, but she too suffers from depression and anorexia. Her parents had a terrible divorce where she got caught in the middle, resulting in her falling deeper into depression and self harm tendencies, as well as her mother becoming very anorexic and depressed, all the while her father was drinking. She felt she couldn't burden her mother with her issues and instead keep it to herself, which she does til today as well.",1
When we are at work we joke around but we all do that. I feel so ashamed. I want to hear your opinion on the fact am i to blame? Was it my fault because something like this happened? **tl;dr**: Something delicate happened between me and my collegue,1
"Original post here: <url> Quick update: my abusive ex, who put forward his candidacy for local council, was elected Friday by acclamation - meaning no one came forward to challenge him, so no election will be necessary, and he is automatically the winner. He is flush with victory at the moment. I have decided to come forward anyways, about the emotional and sexual abuse that I experienced during the relationship. I know I may pay a price, for speaking openly in our small community.",1
"I'm in desperate need for someone online to just understand and talk to me about it, preferably someone that has recovered from it or someone who knows about the addiction. I dream of becoming a father and loving husband. I dream of reaching my goals in life. I dream of being the happy kid I once was. I don't need advices to different clinics as I live in Sweden.",1
"I've been couchsurfing now for 75 days and life is getting harder at this time as money is sinking. Been getting into bad thought loops so I decided to write a blog that allows me to express my sadness through more ""happy"" words. I currently have two posts. [First one <url> was about how I ended up in this situation and describing overall how am I doing and the latest one is about last week and how mentally challenging it was to be sick as a homeless person. <url>",1
"His price is even higher than what I was told and he said that's after a discount. I'm a college student and apart from tuition I have food and other things to fund and I thought that by paying this much I'd at least get my money's worth in therapy, but other than telling him about my anxiety and family, and having him tell me I probably have OCD and Anxiety disorder, all I seem to hear is the rates of the therapies and how it would take over a year of dynamic therapy, preferably 2 times a week, at 80$ a session, and that I should be able to commit if I want to continue. The second session he continued with this spending nearly 30 minutes saying I have 3 options, seeing a psychiatrist and taking pills, going to CBT to treat 'only the symptoms' or seeing a dynamic therapist like him for sessions which would take a year at least to see results. What's more, the second the clock ticks 50 minutes he says have a nice day and sort of kicks me out. So I'm supposed to believe this person talking about money on time I pay him money to talk to me about my greatest fears is gonna help me?",1
"I'm having a rough time right now and going through some things where my anxiety and depression keep dragging me down. My roommates have not really experienced someone with anxiety before really. At least not someone who gets attacks. During the recovery of one of my episodes, I came up with this writing in the notes of my iPhone. So here it is.",1
"I've been trying to remain hopeful that these symptoms won't really start improving until 6-8 weeks like the first time I took it to relieve depression. It doesn't help that after looking up SSRI withdrawal online, I've read reinstating might not work the longer I'm off it and it's recommended to take a very low dose in order to alleviate symptoms. This is leaving me worried since I've stopped for a month and took a higher dosage than I last left off. It doesn't say what happens if I happen to take a high dosage, so I'm worried I'm making things worse by continuing with this high dosage and I have no idea what to do right now. I feel very messed up and I'm scared these withdrawal symptoms will never go away or may become permanent.",1
But the days leading up to the test were the worst. I couldn't sleep 2 nights in a row and had to call in sick to work. I had a near panic attack and was unable to eat much as i felt like throwing up. Before the test my hands were shaking and my heart was racing. I was really not in a state to drive.,1
"Sorry for the super long post but I don't want to tell my mom all this and most of my friends don't know I feel like this almost all the time. I take my medicine for social anxiety every morning and I go to counseling every few weeks, but I've been to a counselor four or five different times over the years and I'm still the same. I think I might be stuck like this. I honestly doubt anyone read this far but if you did, hello! TL;DR freshman year of high school, I'm super anxious about pretty much everything especially PE and disappointing my family by not coming out on top",1
" About a month or two ago I saw my doctor about going on an anti anxiety med for general anxiety disorder (GAD) and was put on Lexapro. I've never taken an SSRI before, but I find it has helped me tremendously with my other anxiety symptoms. However, the globus still remains and I'm at my wits here about how to stop this sensation. Has anyone here experienced this? Is there a way to treat this?",1
"and now it's like he did a complete 180 and decided that I have to do exactly what he wants. I'm sure that he is worried about his children going wild as young adults like he did, which is fair, but frankly, I've always been very responsible with money, drinking, and just about everything else. I've always been told that I'm mature for my age and have never been anything near a problem child. I really don't think there's any cause for him to worry so much about me, and I'm terrified of standing up  to him because, frankly, he does stuff like take my phone away or monitor my spending, so I don't feel safe standing up to him. I obviously can't go along with this forever.",1
"*Sigh* I fucking bailed on the plan today, to get my suicidal headcase of an ass to a hospital for admittance to a psych ward. My PTSD got triggered when I got in the ambulance, so I fucking jumped out the side door. They chased me down an alley and found me hiding behind a truck. Police got involved, more PTSD triggers, but he was nice and spoke French, which comforted me a little.",1
"For a while now I honestly feel like my brain just broke. I am so embarrassed. I used to be really quick at replying to stuff, really good at video games (I would play competitively!! ), The world was easy to navigate... Now it feels like someone beat me with a rock in the head and I never recovered from the concussion. Everything seems so... Fast.",1
"He's not seeing a therapist or psych regularly, which we agreed that he needed to be doing if he was going off his meds. I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself, even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication. Though things are as normal as they can be right now, I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him, like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess), because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway). Well it still ended up being long, my apologies! What should I even do from here?",1
"Example 2. There was this life goal we had together and I happened to accomplish it much quicker than she did, but instead of being happy for me she would get super jealous and make me feel like shit for it. Even though I helped her in every possible way to accomplish that goal too. Example 3. Whenever she sees that I'm upset about something, she'd buy gifts, tell me that she has something planned for us (which later would turn out to be a lie) etc.",1
"In my mind I am in control of this, I donâ€™t feel I â€˜haveâ€™ to try. I can get away. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m using drugs to escape but Iâ€™m not on drugs Iâ€™m just dissociating to a place I want to be. I feel that if I was forced to be in reality Iâ€™d be just as angry and terrified as a drug addict in rehab. I donâ€™t know what to do.",1
"Iâ€™m in Florida, canâ€™t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse. As in me getting my name off lease and him staying here. My fiancÃ© is mentally and emotionally abusive. We have had some physical altercations, like him pushing me down, poking me hard in the chest, him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it. Heâ€™s also broken a few pairs of glasses, a remote control, smashed the hell out of his iPhone, and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.",1
So he hasn't really hit me since we got back together but he's cruel in so many other ways. He will call met fat ass (I'm 5ft8 and 130 pounds) and just had our third child. He tells me I'm ugly and a dumb b****h and tells me I can't do anything right. He constantly calls me a whore. He tells me a whore for not kiwearing a bra in our house.,1
"It's horrible. The thing is, my urologist told me that it was just an overactive bladder and gave me some medicine, but it just worked a couple of days when I was ""totally positive"" about the medicine. Even, after taking the pills I felt great, like in a normal state, but the symptoms are here again. Is it possible that the cause could be my sometimes uncontrollable anxiety? Have someone had the same problem?",1
"I was physically and sexually abused by my mom as a kid. She would pull my pants down and fondle my genitals from the time I was a child up until I moved out for college. This is something where I know it happened, and I can remember time after time how it had happened. About a month ago, though, I had a really vivid and visceral nightmare about a form of sexual abuse that I can't place in a timeline like I can with the other types of abuse. In this nightmare, my mom and I are naked in bed and she is touching me, until I get so scared that I push her away and fall out of the bed.",1
Today was a really bad day. I had no energy and I cried and I thought about suicide all day. I'm afraid things will never change for me. I'm not strong enough to change things for myself and I have no help. What can I do?,1
"During my service I got suddenly rowdy and would fight a lot with marines and civilians that resulted in many nights in jail. I have been to captains mast twice (Inciting a riot, breach of peace, destruction of government property). Today I sometimes I call in sick because I have pauses I call them where I canâ€™t seem to be too far from home or I get a sudden feeling of not being safe or keep my family safe. I have a million excuses why I cannot do something or go somewhere. I canâ€™t fly, I canâ€™t sit in the center of a crowd I must be by the door and there has to be more than one door.",1
"There aren't a lot of people in my life I can talk to. I did have a therapist who I clicked with really well, but I had to stop seeing him when my work comp case closed. I just started seeing a new one but haven't gotten to the point where I really feel I can rely on her yet, as I've only seen her a couple of times. The crisis lines have been very unhelpful. I just need some support.",1
"Hi /r/relationships, I'm hoping you can give me some perspective. I am at a loss on how to handle this situation. I am so sorry at how long this is, but I needed to vent and hopefully one or two kind people will be able to help me process this. I want to provide some background from my side of these events. For the last year, I've been in a high-profile, high-stress management position with my company.",1
"He constantly threaten to take our son and Iâ€™ll never see him again. Last night, I started a journal less about the abuse and more about my feelings on a day to day basis. This morning he hide my meds from me, after an hour I woke him and asked where they were. He cussed me out and told me he not to talk to him until 1pm. Last night, he forced me into our sonâ€™s room and as I was trying to escape he slapped my wrist in the door.",1
"My son was septic with respiratory distress for 5 hours (my husband and i didn't know at the time), and the medical staff was too incompetent to realize. The ambulance staff was even worse. My son almost died in the beat-up ambulance as well. It was horrible. We finally got to a bigger hospital where he was on antibiotics for nearly a month.",1
"*Major trigger warning* I find comfort in confined spaces, and can spend prolonged time in confined spaces verycomfortably. This is odd to most people, but Iâ€™ll explain why. When I was with my parents, they were super abusive. They forced me to watch animals die, and frequently changed around my room so I wasnâ€™t familiar with it. They forcefully put splinters in my feet, allowed men to sexually assault me, and they even pepper sprayed me a couple times as a 2 year old.",1
"But i think the worst part is her emotional abuse. Like having fun to make me scared or cry and also always putting me down like i am not good enough or ignoring me. Also i feel like she is sexually attracted to me (i am 17 now) and uses some shitty pretending to touch me between my legs or butt. I once tried to talk with my dad about it, but he said that he and mom have enough to do and i should pull myself together. I feel like i really have to seek help, but i am so scared that people wont take me serious and think i am exaggerating.",1
Everything about my existence was a burden to her. I wasn't exposed to one huge trauma. I was little traumas over a long period of time. I know feel very unsafe all the time and scare. I'm constantly afraid of I don't know what.,1
"Every day I'd tell myself I was over this girl but I'd see her at school and instantly be reminded of how much I liked her. Every time I saw her I almost wanted to cry. Throughout the year I kept trying to ""win her back"" by forcing intimacy by telling her things about my past I'd never told anyone (never told her about being raped though). This just made her think I was weird. On the first day of summer I noticed she'd blocked me on all forms of social media and I no longer had a way to talk to her.",1
I especially appreciate stories of similar experiences and such. I hope everyone's have a nice day. TL;DR: I ended up with anxiety due to relationship and health anxiety and now I can't stop thinking about how I might some terminal illness (cancer) just because I feel some weird tingling or pain in an area I didn't before. Or even a cough can freak me out a little. If you also/used to suffer from this how do/did you deal with it?,1
"So now I'm here not knowing what to do. I don't want to call the cops because I don't want my mom to get in any trouble for her gambling habits. So I need some advice for what to do incase something like this ever happens again. **tl;dr**: My mom cuts her boyfriend because he grabbed her by the throat and I don't know what to do. **UPDATE**: After this incident with her boyfriend, my mom wants to move out of the house.",1
"People who've been my ""friends"" for a decade stopped talking to me or inviting me to anything after my break-up. A guy who I've been making plans to see for two months on a weekly basis just cancelled, again (we haven't gotten together at all). Another person I was trying to date bailed because of something I can't control. I'm not worth these people's time. My boss scares the daylights out if me (stern Russian lady who expersses herself horribly).",1
Every rational part of me believes I'm retroactively terrified of the fact I almost didn't get to live the life I'm living now. I wish I wouldn't think about it. But I just keep doing it. It's like I get some sick thrill out of the fear and anxiety like it's a horror movie or rollercoaster. I know I shouldn't be feeling that way about it but I am and I don't know why or how to stop it.,1
"We will get through this and I am determined, even it means going to a shelter, to get affordable housing, so i never end up in this situation again! Ive been financially abused in small ways for almost a year, paying more than my share, while he saved. Being forced into buying a computer we couldnt afford then had it thrown at me every fight due to credit card he continuously used (kept under 1k) I also was forced to be precise on where i put things especially when cleaning as to not disrupt him. He hid snacks and 420 from me when I did most of the purchasing.",1
"I've been homeless for a couple days since my roommate completely screwed me by not paying rent for 5 months and hid notices from me. I only had a week to move out, and get things into storage. I was able to find a roof to sleep under for a short time but it's severely roach infested and I have to sleep on the floor. There isn't anything availible at my price range, certainly not on that short of a notice. I had a few prospects but they went to other people.",1
My therapist told me to do some free writes about my anxiety and OCD thoughts (being afraid of panic attacks and fear I will act on violent thoughts) and in the book Imp Of The Mind the author talks about writing out thoughts. I just don't know how to set it up. Do you write as if the thought came true? Do you just write the thought is there and why it isn't true? Anyone do anything like this?,1
"I was left to hold the burden of explaining to other people why he wasn't talking to them, or why he said something hurtful. I was okay with that. But I told him on many, many, very blunt occassions, 'I am not okay with just sucking your dick. I feel like you aren't putting in the effort with me and I feel sick and uncomfortable doing this.' I said this in a variety of forms as well as having panic attacks - not anxiety attacks, full-on violent shivering, mute shut-down, crying, overstimulated, feeling like you're about to die panic attacks - most of the times when we were intimate.",1
It's only happened twice and only happens when he drinks. I love him dearly and want to help/support him. He cries and says he's sorry and admits that he is aggressive when he drinks. I'm so heartbroken I don't know what to do? Is this even considered domestic abuse/violence?,1
I tried some cheese and some had pretty intense flavors and being an highly sensitive person this i think caused some stress. We stood for about an hour when i felt this dropping feeling in my stomach. I knew this was a sign to get some food and sit down but my dad was very happy checking out cheeses so i risked just waiting and chilling out. Then my whole body felt that dropping sensation and my hearing started going. I started getting warm and it felt like pin needles on my body.,1
He's in a group of people. The problem is that because of what happened to me (police brutality/stalking) the general public think the police are the good guys and are not understanding when I give them explain that's not always the case. My doctor was almost treating my fear of police as a phobia instead of what it truly is... PTSD! This is my first post here. I appreciate any insight or experience y'all may have with seeking treatment.,1
"I have been abused mentally and physically by my step-father when being only 7 and it didn't stop until 12 when I moved to Britain and lived there to this day (17 yr now). Everyday I was told how worthless I was and was getting beat regularly. However I coped with it. At the start when I came to England, I was crying all the time, when I was called stupid, and idiot or was hit by a friend (A kind of a friendly abuse, you know when you just want to annoy your friends).

"I donâ€™t know if anxiety/depression have anything to do with memory performance, but Iâ€™ve noticed that I remember a lot less compared to when I wasnâ€™t in a depressed and anxious state.

"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for reading. I moved my family from Texas to Colorado thinking I had a new job lined up on the other side - this job fell through. Fortunately I have a new job starting January 23rd, but I don't have enough in savings to carry me through. We are running very low on necessities like bread and milk. I am unable to go to the local food banks because I still only have a Texas DL, I can't afford to transfer my license or vehicle registration.",1
"Hourly employees start arriving at 4am and then myself and the other managers will delegate the days plan to the employees. We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items, recover the floor and excute the GMâ€™s planned item moves for the day, so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I donâ€™t mind physical labor and hard work, itâ€™s actually my favorite part of my job, but itâ€™s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks, but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so itâ€™s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours, or helping out in the deli and/or bakery. Some days Iâ€™m lucky enough to get a lot of time in the office to complete my daily tasks, but most days I do not.",1

He told me he didn't feel loved unless I was having sex with him, and only then did he feel happy. He would threaten constantly to leave, and oftentimes did as a power grab when I got ""out of hand"", and then would make me beg for him back. I felt so unsure of myself. I wasn't enough, and that's why he was leaving.",1
"Later that night someone snuck into the building we were sleeping in and killed Daniel.. he was chopped up with what I presume was a hatchet. I don't know why they spared me or Jay to this fucking day but I'd gladly take Daniel's place, he was the sweetest boy I ever knew. We were heartbroken and I vowed that I would find the bastard and get revenge for Daniel. I'm crying as I am typing this part because this is what fucked me up the most. Chapter seven: adopted",1
"After unsuccessfully looking for a girlfriend on dating sites and personals, I made a simple post on CL looking for a friend that basically said that my life was too much of a mess for me to really date, but I'm trying to be more social, etc. I was upfront with the fact that I have PTSD and am getting help. I was expecting mostly spam messages from bots, etc... surprisingly like 90% replies were just mostly people telling me to grow up without even knowing what my life is like or what I've gone through. The other 10% were adult babysitters and spam. This is kind of what lead to my isolation in the first place.",1

He walked into the house because the door was unlocked (because some people leave their door unlocked if they're downstairs or something) and he walked into the kitchen and it was a crack house, immediately he had a gun pointed at him and he froze for a second and ran back to his van, the guy shot half a dozen times and hit the rear view mirror, he almost got shot so many times while running to the van, and when I saw this I was hysterically sobbing in the middle of the school hall and when I got home I got to my mom and kept screaming ""he almost died he almost died"" and my mom thought I said he died because I could barely breathe, he seems to be over it now but every time he is a little late coming home from work or hasn't replied in awhile I get so scared hes dead and late at night I can't sleep because I'm scared this is the last day I'll have with him.

"Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person, well it ended up being exactly what I feared, she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so ""over dramatic"" and that ""I'm just anxious for attention"".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own, she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that, but she has been like this for a few years now, I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was ""nothing"" and it turned out to be cellulitis.

My mom doesnâ€™t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (Iâ€™m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really canâ€™t/shouldnâ€™t) so she can divorce him, she only wants to wait because she canâ€™t support us by herself.

Nope...that's just not going to happen, as soon as he was out of earshot the cRap music and loud partying resumed. So I sit in my room perplexed as what to do about this,(wanting to get some much needed sleep) as it seems asking them to turn the music down and to quiet down was not going to happen. (obviously they're above the rules and law and don't give a shit about others in the motel) So I sat there thinking and I decided to call the owner/manager one last time and tell him PLEASE get these people to be quiet and turn the music down and to quit being so damn loud. He tells me ""I have told them 2 times to turn the music down and be quiet and they won't listen to me, why don't you call the police yourself"" I was floored by him saying this to me and told him it was NOT my job to enforce the rules, it was his.",1

I definitely do have a skill set learned from my time in therapy that I feel I can rely on right now, but if I get worse I am not sure if just that is enough...though hopeful I will not get worse.

"I was severely neglected as a child by my mother, but this isn't about the neglect (although it may make an appearance at some point), I think my twin and I were sexually abused by her first boyfriend (the man she had an affair with). I have a distinct memory of lying in my bed at night and there being a male figure crawling up towards me, this is more of a still frame though. The others however I remember vividly to a point, one was a very inappropriate tickling game where my sister was under her duvet and he was on top of her tickling, except he was also humping, I can't remember much more than that, the other is walking to his house, I remember the exact route, going in and him showing me his house, I can't remember anything once he showed me his bedroom, other than the bedding was white, I don't remember leaving or what happened in between, but I remember things like he had an Eiffel Tower figure he made in his front room. I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",1

"I know no break up is fun, but you know what I mean. Without going into too much detail: she was unhappy, cheated on me, broke up with me, started dating other guy. We also live together. It's been three weeks and the stress had caused my stomach to twist into knots I cannot untie... Not really sure where else got with this. I just want to stop feeling like this.",1
"I'm aware I have problems when it comes to dating, I get jealous, paranoid and suspicious very easily. I hate it about myself and hide it from my boyfriend very well. Take for example my bf, we have each other on snapchat, we maybe send one or two to each other a day it's not like a thing we do but it could be, I tried to send him more but it wasn't reciprocated. Yet I always see his snapchat score go up by like 30 or more at a time (I know I shouldn't snoop it just feeds my problems but I can't help it). Anyway I just get jealous that he snaps loads to other people but not me, I don't know who.. it could be another girl.. he never sends a face pic to me but is he to others and if so why not me?",1
"Iâ€™m trying to get into Freelance writing, but these libraries want physical original IDâ€™s, so Iâ€™m doing everything by phone, which is now also hard to doâ€¦ because of charger thieves. Ugh. Times like these generate negative attitudes towards the world, and myself. The fact that noone has the time and patience for me just makes me wonder if Iâ€™m a piece of shit. No.",1
"there are guards you have to ask for everythig and the other people who live there - while most are ""ok"" some either look like trouble or actually give trouble. . In theory I would have moved to the capital and taken up fitness instructor course and applied for an education. only my GPA is bad even though I took higher level classes than requirred. so I need to fix my study habits and I need to either sue my dad or find closure with him and cut him out of my life.",1
Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has. The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out. He was full of compliments for me but they were pretty generic and he took me on a bunch of dates. The last few days I was kind of avoiding him and he kind of tried getting controlling. Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
"""Fuck you bitch, I can make your life hell and get you kicked out of here. I manage this place when the owner is not around"" Needless to say that is all a lie from him, He is here from DSS/Social Services just like I am. What I am worried about is my safety and security. This guy is obviously mentally ill and a drug addict and alchie, and now I am really concerned that he will do something to me because I stood up to him and his nonsense bullshit.",1
"Just realised in my greatest moment of need, no one could be there for me despite me seeking it out and reaching out first. These are 'friends' Ive talked to about issues before. My heart is beyond broken to find myself at once again a second round of realisation that I have no friends to be there for me. People have stuff to get on in their lives and cannot always be there for me. I get it.",1
"My situation is that I might be homeless for about a month. I have plenty of money coming in from my clients during the month of October--more than enough to meet the 3x income requirement for most apartments in the city where I plan to move (my hometown). However, my lease here ends Sept 30. I don't have quite enough to meet the 3x income requirement before then. Some of my clients have really slow pay schedules.",1
"So I have a csf leak. It isn't diagnosed, but being that its pretty much the only thing(I don't have any heart issues) that causes orthostatic headaches and and the other problems im having, its probably a csf leak. If I stand for more than 10 minutes or so after I wake up I develope a horrible headache that feels like its pressing downwards, and I basically become retarded. Like I cant even walk straight. I think my vision is starting to be affected too.",1
"That being said, I feel like every idea I have to contribute gets shot down. It doesn't help that I'm not the best at communicating ideas. I feel like I'm at a dead end and am not being considered to move up because of it. It's gotten me so anxious that I don't know what to do except look for other opportunities. I feel like he's just pretending to appreciate what I do.",1
"I recently became depressed and am now understanding that Iâ€™ve also had anxiety my whole life but I am waiting to see a specialist to have a diagnosis. My doctor is pretty easy goin and will give me pretty much whatever medication I want. Lately Iâ€™ve been trying this and trying that to find a good combination of meds. My foquest would make me very depressed in the evenings and morning so I went off foquest and went on Wellbutrin XL at 150mg a day. This helped my depression but my attention, memory, and focus faltered.",1
I lost a child because of this man and i went back for round 2? Am I nuts? Why am I so surprised i've come out looking like i've just had 10 round with Tyson? Advice please - anyone gone through a similar experience? What did you do?,1
"Things my boyfriend does make me feel bad sometimes (for no reason actually), like when he doesnÂ´t text me back for a few hours ( because heÂ´s really busy with work but he texts me back whenever he can, I know it ) and I start having weird thoughts, like ""Is he already tired or bored of me? Is this just another guy who made me fall in love with him and think that he loves me and cares about me, and he actually doesnÂ´t give a damn about me?"" I donÂ´t want to have these thoughts, so I try to stop myself from thinking about that all, but sometimes I just canÂ´t stop and I feel too bad ( for no real reason actually because I honestly feel like he loves me a lot. ). I feel like a bad anxiety attack is coming, and I canÂ´t stop it.",1
"Credit card debt makes me depressed, itâ€™s been terrible. Today I only have 3 with the rest paid off. Only about 6 months until Iâ€™m in a better position to get back on me feet! Iâ€™m trying to get an easy 2nd job so itâ€™ll be even sooner, but Iâ€™m always shot at the end of my 10 hour days and never getting a good night sleep. I just have to do it.",1
"The next day after a meeting he tried confronting her about being ignored. To other people itâ€™s nothing, however to me, I canâ€™t stand the thought of her being assaulted or harassed in that way. I think he might be working later today when sheâ€™s working. We both discussed that she would â€œtell him to stop and that she has a boyfriend and if he doesnâ€™t stop sheâ€™ll tell the managerâ€ which Iâ€™m okay with. Except all I want to do is protect her, part of me knows that sheâ€™s going to be okay, but I need some advice about how I should address the issue if this guy doesnâ€™t stop, keep in mind the fact that I can wrestle and basically fight, and can someone tell me something that will help me hold onto the hope?",1
"I'm anxious right now I hope my life won't be miserable this year. I can't believe I have to get my eyes checked because one of them is getting sore. My life should be about me, not about medical doctors. I really love the idea of pain and sickness (sarcasm) I'm just so bloody sick of the crap. I really am.",1
"I have suffered for years through an abusive relationship with my husband. Drunk driving, attempting to detain me in one place so he could continue to yell at me, child endangerment, stalking, physical and sexual abuse, cheated on me multiple times, (including one instance I am sure was actually rape). I kicked him out months ago and filed for divorce as soon as I was able after that. Now I have a court date for the restraining order for me and my son, which I finally gathered up the courage (and the witness testimony) to file. I know that everything I've said is true, and I'm confident that my evidence is strong.",1
"I have to talk to him and make nice, and pretend its ok, but I feel unsettled and on edge around him. I guess I don't know what to do, it's a complicated situation, and I feel that I'll never get the ""real talk"" I'd like to have with him, or any sort of apology. He seems rather narcissistic, not as bad as my own father, but enough to not want to admit his wrong doing and own up to it. Is this something I can get over on my own while still around him? Am I over exaggerating?",1
"My father was diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer, and while it's well-controlled, the side effects of his hormonal and chemo treatments have left him far more emotional (but, at least, unable to just sublimate his depression/anxiety into anger and vent it at any available target anymore), and the physical side effects have forced him into an early retirement, meaning 80% of the time he's home and sitting in the livingroom. He's no longer directing the same vitriol and venom at me that he used to, and neither does my sister, but... It's all the little things they do to invalidate my feelings, treating more like a live-in servant than a family member, and the occasional outbursts if they get angry/upset that trigger me badly... It's making me lose ground, lose progress, and I'm having more and more trouble coping with everyday life...  And I'm afraid I'm going to just, break. Crumble under the weight of it all...",1
"Also, youâ€™re incredibly ditzy and that gives off the idea that youâ€™re stupid.â€ Last week, she rudely corrected me in front of a patient and then rolled her eyes and shook her head. The patient leaned into me and said, â€œWhat the heck was that about?â€ I finally got fed up and went to my boss. This coworker is very manipulative and loves to gaslight me. She will say or do something mean and then when confronted, will deny the behavior and go off on all the things she saw me do â€œwrongâ€ (basically stupid shit that is none of her business anyway. I sneezed into my elbow once and she lectured me on washing my hands.",1
"Iâ€™m tired of watching the days waste away before me because Iâ€™m so useless. Iâ€™m useless from the insomnia, the depression, anxiety and lack of motivation. My chronic illness has destroyed my life, the resulting PTSD has only made it worse. I donâ€™t know where this post is going. I donâ€™t know what any comments will say.",1
"But Iâ€™m wondering if anyone here has chronic pain, and feels the connection between the two. Now the PTSD, has been been coming up. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not alone, but during the Kavanaugh hearings my symptoms became very severe. Itâ€™s still not entirely better. I know many studies have been done connecting PTSD with chronic pain, especially for women.",1
"I literally have never been sick so much. Normally if I get sick at all itâ€™s when allergy season comes, so like once a year. My hair is definitely falling out way more than it normally does. Has this happened to anyone? I know itâ€™s almost over.",1
"Even if that's true (and I believe her), I hate it. I've tried to explain my point of view and why I hate them still talking but every time it's brought up we always just end up arguing. She says I have no reason to be jealous of him and that she's VERY happy with me and that I'm overreacting. I'm not trying to create a problem when there isn't one but I feel like I have a point? I never want to tell her to stop talking to a friend, but their history makes me uncomfortable.",1
He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood. It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter. My family would be willing to take her in but we're not doing well w/ money either.  I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do. He's been horrible to his family since forever.,1
"I would rather kill myself than hurt other people so why the fuck did that even occur to me? My therapist told me I'm meant to be alive and hugged me and I don't even know why because how could I be meant to be alive if I have thoughts like this? What's the point? It honestly feels like depression or ptsd or whatever this is has stripped me of normal human emotions and humanity and I'm just like this vacuum moving around undetected that people, like my therapist, fail to see is awful and unlovable and unfixable. I don't feel anything in conversations, I have trouble with empathy sometimes.",1
"My boss asked my lead, who is friends with that person about it. My lead came to me and told me that she knows that i spoke to the big boss and they both expressed to me that what i did was the right thing. i dont really trust them to keep this confidential anymore. Im worried ill gain the tattletale reputation, and people will be a little more rude than they have been. How can I feel less anxious and more positive about this situation?",1
"I spoke with her after all was said and done and asked why. Reasons she gave me were that I didn't do enough housework and she felt underappreciated for the work she did, that my libido is considerably higher that hers and it made her feel inadequate so she went outside the marriage to feel more like she could satisfy a person's sex drive, and that I'm boring and the newness of everything was gone. Now I'm here picking up the pieces and trying to decide if I can learn to trust her again, if I'm willing to put in the work, and what I could have done to be a better husband to avoid this. I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I couldn't even hold a marriage together for 6 months. Currently she's sick because she also has untreated lupus and the stress of all of this has caused her immune system to weaken, her joints to swell, and her muscles to ache.",1
"I get a text from my brother that was essentially, ""fuck off and die, nobody wants you here anymore."" Clearly I need to move out, but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend, and although we see each other often, we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.) Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me. I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense. So, I guess my question is, what do I do?",1
"Where each person does what they do because they love the other person and get pleasure out of pleasing their partner. And I know this sounds so horrible and I hate myself for it, but I almost feel like it will never happen. Like she's been broken. Even if you put the pieces back together for a broken glass, it will never truly be like new. And I feel awful for feeling that way but I've been trying (and patiently waiting) for nearly a year now.",1
Relying on an app (that depended on wifi) for calls and texts became a hassle so I tried to get an Obama phone. I was denied because I couldn't provide a bill with my name and address on it. Of course I don't have an address: I'M HOMELESS! How am I suppose to get a job when I don't have a phone (one where I can be reached wherever/whenever). The system was designed perfectly...,1
"They have lives outside the group and are often coming from far away to go to this group. Should I try and be friends with them? I feel like they're not going to want to hang out with a dorky 23 year old, and I have no idea what we'd even do anyway. I also tried Bumble BFF to make friends but found the constant swiping and texting to be really boring and depressing. There's only so much bland small talk a person can make.",1
"DO NOT BLAME HIM. PEOPLE WHO ABUSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST MANIPULATIVE AND BELIEVABLE LIARS. That being said; Parent's if you have a child, who is going to EXTREMES to say show their disapproval for a person, LISTEN TO THEM. CHILDREN FUCKING KNOW. And it is YOUR responsibility to ensure THEIR safety and happiness, not satisfy your own at their cost.",1
Do I ask the boss (whoâ€™s like family to me) to not bring him back once our coming winter layoff is over? How do I continue to stay sane while seeing this guy who is abusive to my extended family and completely absent with my immediate family while telling our friends heâ€™s a happy uncle?   ---   **tl;dr**: SO's brother works with me. He is abusive to SO and her family and won't acknowledge pregnancy.,1
"I never had that symptom before and I just want to know if anyone else has, what has helped manage your dizziness? For me it will trigger panic attacks which I hate so much. I've tried zofran for nausea that did nothing (prob cuz it's anxiety nausea not stomach nausea). Are there any meds for dizziness or vertigo? Thanks!",1
"It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that. I'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all.",1
"I [F18] have been with one guy [M21] for 3 years and within the last 4-5 months Iâ€™ve wanted to change our relationship dynamic from serious to casual. I still think I love him, but I find myself thinking about other people more and part of myself wants to see if I can do better. We get along great but Iâ€™ve always felt that our relationship has lacked an emotional aspect on his part. Part of the reason I want to end it also has to do with our financial situation - weâ€™re both broke but I want to start working more to save more money because Iâ€™m trying to be more financially independent. I feel like he is somehow holding me back from my personal goals.",1

It is emotionally and physically taxing for us all to deal with these. I am worried that one day someone might snap and she may become injured.

"The thought of interviewing for a job with a man in a suit makes me want to curl up and die. Despite living and going to college in the town I grew up in, I don't have any close friends. I'm different than most girls at my college, I guess. I don't wear the giant tshirts, and I'm not in a sorority. I don't go out at night and party or go to football games.",1
"Hi, just wondering if anyone can relate to this. Sorry I made this long. I tend to have little or no anxiety in social situations... when they are currently happening. It's *after* the event/conversation has passed that I began to analyze the things I said/did and the reactions of other people. I don't have this problem too badly with strangers or people I see regularly and am used to.",1
"She comes crying to me and formulates a plan to break up. She talks to Joe about their issues and her will to leave him wilts. She stays with him. Rinse and repeat, except it gets worse over time. How can I break the cycle, or help her break the cycle?",1
"My troubles began when I confronted her about withdrawing large and frequent amounts of cash from her account and asked her what she was spending all that money on when she wasn't paying for my siblings. I asked her for my 9 year old sister's dad number , so I could bring up her not spending the child support money she was receiving on my sister. She refused to give me his number and since then I cannot even talk to her. She has even told me not to take my sister out with me and my brother because she says she does not have money to pay me back. If i mention anything about what I spend on them she say ""I need to see a receipt"" but when I ask if she bought anything for them and to show me a receipt she says ""Of course I don't keep them"".",1
"When I get stressed and angry and blow up, I find myself blaming and cursing God a lot for the situation that has made me angry. Like He has always had it out to get me. Afterwards I feel so stupid and ashamed for my outbursts, usually over very trivial thing. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety disorder however I never told my psych or therapist about this part of me because I just don't like talking about it. I have a child now who is turning 18 mo old, and yesterday I had another big outburst when driving with her due to a stupid road rage issue.",1
"I relate to a lot of the symptoms, but what happened to me wasn't ""life threatening"" it was more of a childhood trauma that has a lot to do with growing up in a chaotic home. My brothers tried to kill himself twice, (TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDE) and that vision of him holding the knife to his throat or choking himself with a belt WILL NEVER GET OUT OF MY HEAD. hence the reason I'm typing this at two am. It's really bad today and I have gotten zero sleep since midnight of last night. I just can't shake those images out of my head EVER.",1
"And I woke up. It took 3 nurses and some sort of shot to calm me down when I woke up and I had to lay there limp for an hour in the recovery room by myself. They then put me in the maternity ward, sharing a room with a mother who just had her baby. The second surgery was a few days later because the surgery was incomplete. I found out when the part of the baby came out and I slipped on it in the bathroom, my husband found me in a pool of blood crying on the ground.",1
"I broke up with my bf of 2.5 yrs on Sunday after suspecting he was the reason why I had fallen into depression for the past year or so. I became more irritable, rude, negative and angry... which was not like my usual positive, polite, and bubbly self. He was often very negative, had anger issues/tantrums, impatient, interrupted me a lot, would ditch me for cocaine, didn't know how to drink alcohol (often consumes until he pukes), was a hypochondriac, always broke (yet had money for weed/shatter or sports betting or junk food or alcohol...), but at the same time did not look after his own health unless I pushed him to... just a lot of care-taking and issues. He has depression and anxiety as well. One of the things that really killed me inside about him was his last girlfriend who had died in a car crash about 1 year before he met me.",1

"Another update: I received two messages from random women yesterday. It turns out my boyfriend/abuser has been cheating on me, which is not surprising at this point. One of them, he went to get us food while I was home with my son, he paid for this woman's family's meal and got her number, and has been asking her out for drinks every couple days. She sent me screen shots of their conversations and he said, ""The ring I gave her is simply a gift to the woman carrying my child. We have had a rocky relationship and I can not see us as anything more than co-parenting"", then said, ""I don't work well with crazy"".",1
"Can anyone else suggest any other resources that would be available to her?

"It's been a few months since things happened. I want to talk about what happened, though, but most people are so tired of hearing about it, so I am quiet about it now. I would like to talk about it here where others can understand, if you don't mind. I'm sorry if it is triggering for anyone. Therapy is in the future but not for a couple more months so I have a couple months left of reeling until I can deal with it in a therapeutic setting.",1
"As mentioned above, my girlfriends gets pissed off when I act uninterested in her friends and starts accusing me of hating them, which is ridiculous because I hardly even know them, and she gets really upset and stops talking to me for awhile. I'm starting to think that it's gonna end up being a choice between me or her friends and so far, I'm losing. TL;DR: My girlfriend's friends are annoying as fuck and I'm not very fond of them. I don't ever say anything negative about them, yet my girlfriend still gets pissed off if I don't praise them. All our arguments are about them.",1
"She has had wounds on her face once, one doctor saw them, wrote them down, and offered to call the police. They replied that she'd have to come there by herself and sue her husband.

"But I told him that Iâ€™m not over it and his response was kinda like â€œ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.â€ So now I feel pressured to forgive him and itâ€™s frustrating because he didnâ€™t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her. In fact, I remember him telling me to shut up. He didnâ€™t give a damn about my brother when he pushed him against a wall to yell at him when he was only in middle school.

"And godforbid I see an insect anywhere near me, even if itâ€™s through a car window, jar, or whateverâ€¦ oh boy, I get VERY anxious. Sometimes I have never ending anxiety that lasts for multiple days, and flares up at the worst times. And if I drink caffeine, oh man, that makes it even WORSE. Nicotine withdrawal can compound this sometimes, increasing my anxiety twofold, and, ironically, making me too anxious to go out to smoke; which causes a vicious cycle that while temporary, can really fuck me up for the time itâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m wondering what I can do.",1
"Most mild of it was my dad used to hit my butt and call it a love tap, I told him not to do that and heâ€™d say â€œyouâ€™ll understand when you are olderâ€ Like I said this is mild and I donâ€™t think constitutes and sex abuse, but I was absolutely uncomfortable and my boundaries were crossed hardcore. I told my dad I wanted to play football when I was 8. He told me I should try for the lingerie league instead. My mom used to go clothes shopping for me, and he would tell me to wear the opened back and low cut shirts because â€œthatâ€™s what the boys likeâ€ even though I didnâ€™t want to One night he walked into my room completely naked and turned my light on, I woke up and he stood there for about five seconds completely nude, and then turned the light off.",1

Yes I do know that my mom is wrong for that, but me and my siblings can't say or do anything as she is our mother. So they argue about these these things constantly every single day.",1
"on to friends, I recently moved into my first apartment with my college roommate, her boyfriend, and another girl. I just feel lie everyone else in the house is so much closer and its really nerve wracking living with people in the first place especially because I know the boyfriend is a bit more reserved and having trouble adjusting i think to living with three girls. my roommate from last year is trying to be supportive but i know my low energy along with her own problems is sucking the life out of her som im trying not to bother her. in the past month, i've broken up with a creepy guy, taken my friend to the ER, constantly felt ignored because technology sucks and i'm left on read if i even try, an ex has obsessively messaged me, and then the whole issues with the friends also in the leadership of clubs with me. im just a fucking mess.",1
"I'm scared to start the eviction process but I NEED to protect myself and my son. Hell, im even scared to  ask this asshole to take the trash out. I don't know what to do. I feel like an empty shell of a person with no strength to get out of this mess.  This is mostly a rant but does anyone have any advice or words of encouragement?",1
"I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I'm just curious how it went for most people who were diagnosed with PTSD. Over the past 2 years or so - since an event happened in my life that I can't ever forget about -, my anxiety has deepened a bunch. It's gotten to the point now where I regularly have nightmares about this event despite never remembering dreams, and any loud noise makes me want to cry, despite the fact I can't cry for the life of me. I have a few other things people commonly site, but I'd rather not talk about them here on reddit. I'm trying to gather the courage to see a professional about this, but for the time being I want to know how to went for you when you first thought you might have it - or if you even knew, for that matter.",1
"Because not really. I would have survived, I always have before, I have gone three and four days without eating a single thing on dozens of occasions in the last fifteen years, and I will be fine. The guy is wonderful, and has helped me a great deal. But it felt like an intentional attempt to act like I am a burdensome charity case. I just don't know.",1
"It was terrible. I got pregnant again, after he forcibly took my birth control away, my 2nd son was born in Chile, I didn't realize once I had my child in Chile I couldn't leave with my son without the father's permission. I think that was part of his plan. I lived 4 years of brutal hell. I finally made it back home, in 2006 when one of the police officers who were called after he beat me, luckily was married to a woman who worked at the American Embassy, and they got me home within 2 weeks, with both my son's.",1
Iâ€™ve quit weed. Iâ€™ve started having nightmares again. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with PTSD (finally) and am working very little to try to get through this all. Now Iâ€™ve gone no contact with my dad and Tim as well. Dad never really respected this (as he never agrees with my views about what I need) Sent an email to Tim last November informing him that I canâ€™t be around him anymore.,1
"It did still worry me a little though. Then last night, I rushed to a doctor because I was getting severe chest pains and my heart was beating so fast. And today I've just been getting so many of my old symptoms back. Trouble breathing, choking sensations, weird body aches...you name it. I can't help but feel I've somehow taken two steps backward after doing so well.",1
"I need information. As emotional as I am right now, I know I'm not thinking straight and am probably missing something as I research on my own. Any advice, any info, any resource, or organizations that I can apply to to help pay for this is greatly appreciated. I'm in Kansas if that helps... Thank you.",1
"I want to talk about this because I have no support group, and my wife can't handle much more. My uncle lives very close to me in NH. I want to get a news station to take my story but they say it was to long ago. I will be posting more under the title <username> My hope is you will read this comment, and maybe it's happened to you.",1
"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where Iâ€™ve felt threatened. These things have ruined my trust and love for him over time. The controls and double standards that are in place are extensive. So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving? I guess I need an extra push.",1
"I had no more than three consecutive appointments with each specialist before being shifted away to a different department, then being put on a 3-6 month waiting list. I eventually got a new psychologist who admitted after four sessions he didn't have a clue what to do with me, so I quit seeking treatment for a year. I've since attempted treatment again and was referred to CBT despite my protests. After two half hour sessions, they decided to refer me back to psychology. I've been on a waiting list for the past 4 months and am beginning to lose hope.",1
"They discharged me. I told a nurse at a health clinic though, where I got sutured, that I just can't deal with the PTSD anymore, and I feel awful on this injection of flupentixol. I'm suicidal. I'm suicidal, and I keep thinking I should just go through with it this time. But this is a cry for help: what should I do?",1
"I will browse a book on a subject that I want or need to study, research it, think about how it's going to be, then when the time for studying comes, I'm thinking about something else. Sometimes I spend the day thinking about that hardcore workout I'm gong to do in the evening, and then I spend the whole workout session thinking about something else. Sometimes even when I'm talking to people I like I realize my mind will wander. Does anyone feel these things? Do you think it's related to anxiety, or do I have ADHD or something else?",1
"I've been in therapy (and will go back soon now) but I've never had to practice harm reduction around self harm--I need practical advice. I know that because I've never felt so out of control than last night when I was hitting myself. TL;DR I got drunk last night, destroyed my room, and hit myself on the head hard enough to give myself welts for the first time in my adult life. I need advice on not doing this self harm crap.",1
"Short-end is, my brain is using physical disorders like seizures, because my brain has had enough and gone AWOL. On top of this, I have these events where I black out. Time stops, or happens differently for me. I have flashes, seeing things not there and that sort. The other night, the girlfriend and I are walking and I am seeing the sky light up, and hearing screaming.",1
"For a while now, I have been getting very little sleep. Maybe an hour or two at the most every night. Iâ€™m exhausted throughout the day despite being at work surrounded by very enthusiastic people 6 days a week. Yet when i get home and Iâ€™m alone, I canâ€™t sleep even though i am so tired. My worries and my stress is constantly nagging me.",1
I can have it in front of me and still overthink and ask my self over and over. Any advice or opinions? Thanks. P.S. I donâ€™t suffer a lot when Iâ€™m busy at work or with friends.,1
"I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldnâ€™t take my name off the lease, that they wouldnâ€™t care. I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past, and what he says to me and his actions. I believe they would vouch for me. I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called, screaming, damage, etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease. Thoughts?",1
"Summa summarum: I got attacked by two guys, without any provcation. My nose broke, so even if i didn't want to make a charge, the police automatically makes a charge since it's agravated assault, since a bone broke -this is the law here-. I don't really want to talk much about it, because it ""triggers"" me. So, one day my phone rings, and a police officer called me, that i need to go to the police station to a so called ""confrontation"". I was like what?",1
"We've been through so much. This is easily the toughest break up I've ever had; my other relationships were very easy to get over. **TL;DR** I broke up with my bf who had anger issues, financial issues, drug and alcohol issues, depression and anxiety, and unresolved feelings from a gf that died in a car crash 1 year before he met me. But his good qualities where he was considerate, loyal, caring, honest, gentlemanly and supportive is what makes me miss him. Especially his good-bye text.",1
"Oh fucking boy! My ex boyfriend made me think he was Prince Charming, but then it turned out he was just an asshole who wanted to date my ex bully/stalker. She is JUST like me because she was obsessed with me for one and a half years. She is a prettier me, so instead of leaving me like a normal person, he abused me and used his incredibly strong narcissism to make every problem I had about him. He tried to make me dump him so his plan would all correlate.",1
"I am SO PISSED just because i look tired and wearing dirty clothes doesnt mean Im up to no good. I have already filed a complaint with the bbb, attorney general, called my bank to see if i can get that money back. Im thinking while Im stuck here, to contact the local news paper. This man and his housekeeper wife, whom I forgot to add, called me a ""skank"" Im dead serious. So i was falsely accused and insulted, and had my money robbed.",1
"I work as a security guard at a busy office building and everytime i make eye contact with my people  I can literally see them shuddering inside. It probably down to the fact I have an intense stare and tend to stare in people's too eyes long,but I don't know what  the social etiquette is ,what do you do when you're walking along a corridor and you bump into someone you just said hi to a few seconds ago, what do you do when you turn around and unintentionally lock eyes with a work colleague. Please someone help,teach my how to make normal eye contact in social situations. It's getting to the point now where work colleagues are going out their  way to avoid making eye contact with me. Please help",1
"And I hated him too. I had dreams of him stabbing me in the chest. Eventually I went to my mum, essentially I wanted out, him or me, like a stroppy teenager, and I made her tell me what was going on. He'd been making death threats, this time, and the last time too. He'd kill us all because we'd held him back.",1
"I've stayed up at night hearing them quietly talk about things they can't pay right now, trying to figure out the order to deal with debts, what they can do to make this Christmas feel like normal. The only thing I know right now is that I don't know what is going to happen next. I don't know where my dad will live if he has to sell what he and my mother worked so hard for over the years. I don't know where my siblings and I will go if we run into troubles. I don't even know if my family will be able to afford any sort of funeral right now.",1
"One of my flatmates has started distancing  herself from me and I don't know what to do. I've never experienced this before as I've never really had a friendship this close with someone before. We used to see each other multiple times a day, when we were both in the flat we used to spend loads of time in each other's rooms just chilling and chatting. But recently she's been spending more time with other people rather than me. Before today I don't think I saw her for about a week which is crazy considering how close we were and that we live under the same roof.",1
Laundry. Lots of it. With my ass still against the door I grab the overflowing laundry basket. Overturn it. Sit on the fucking thing.,1
All I can do is think about how bad finals are going to be. I hate it so much. I'm going to be so tired. I'm going to fail. My grades are so low I have to do great to keep them above passing.,1
"I didn't want any of this.. I literally had NO CHOICE in ANY of this!!! If I didn't have kids I would not be here, 100%. I pray every night that I would just die in my sleep... then LOL no sleep, no death, just lots of screaming in my head and ruminating anxious thoughts, bad memories on top of bad memories. THIS is hell.",1
"I was walking to a class when someone behind me at their locker dropped their stuff. I went into a panic and I started reliving the trauma. After it went away, I told my friends about it outside of class. In response, they started jokingly throwing things at the ground (including some of my stuff). I started crying in the middle of class, but no one noticed.",1
"I asked him how he's doing to fund this, if there are any bursaries and if so, how much these are, but he never gives a clear answer.   ---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is unemployed, looking for 'perfect' job until he starts his Medicine degree, unsure how he will fund this degree. I resent him for poor financial judgement and day-time chilling. How to change this?",1
"I'm new to this so please forgive me. I'm not very good at expressing my emotions. I need advice/help. I was molested multiple times by my biological dad when I was 5 up until middle school (so like 10 yrs old). After many times in the past telling my mom that my dad had ""touched me weird"" my mom had gotten annoyed and mad at me.",1
Went to my first survivors of incest mtg yesterday. Sexually abused between 4/5-8/9. Have been crying for the last 3 hours and canâ€™t think of anything else except how lonely and how much of a failure Iâ€™ve become. Iâ€™ve been in therapy since 19 but hadnâ€™t disclosed to ANYONE about the sexual abuse by my two brothers. Then I was forced to disclose to my therapist the truth about the abuse when one of the brothers reached out to me one random day  saying he wanted to perform sexual acts on me.,1
Since over the summer he has became homeless and gotten into drugs. He was living in his car and I was jogging one evening he approached me and he confronted me. I was so scared I kind of just stood there and he was insulting me and calling me every name in the book. He tried to get me to use my phone so he can call my mom and I denied his request. He said that if I don't let him use my phone he's going to stab.,1
"Hey all! I'm in San Diego CA and about 2 years ago I was diagnosed with lupus nephritis. I haven't had the most stable care and have had to move all over the country just to maintain safety. Most recently, my mother who I have a very rough (to say the least) relationship with said she would help take care of me financially as I cannot work right now. Well for some reason this last month my mom just stopped paying my rent which led to eviction.",1
Sure enough she always sends us home. Every Wednesday I feel intense dread. I'm afraid to go into work the next day. A few of u may remember but just about a week ago I contemplated suicide. I always have anxiety and sadness.,1
"Hi. So, my husband is emotionally and mentally abusive. I've tried to leave several times but he threatens to kill himself if I do, by crashing his car or running into traffic. However, I have nowhere to go even if I do. My family dosent want/can't afford to have me live with them again.",1
"I have Bipolar 1 disorder and CPTSD. I literally overwhelm LCSWs and MFts with my symptoms. They have no idea where to begin - because it isn't their expertise - they are generalists! When I was able to choose my provider, I could choose someone who specializes in CPTSD or Bipolar 1. I could do DBT, EMDR, or Somatic Experiencing.",1
"I was the designated driver for my parents and grandmother at Greek restaurant that was having a private wine tasting. There was some belly dancer there and for whatever fucking reason my mom started telling me to go dance with her. I told her I didn't want to, she kept pushing me. When my answers did not satisfy her, she called the belly dancer over and told her to dance with me. I froze up briefly then just fucking left the restaurant.",1
"no one can diagnose me with PTSD because it is not! i don''t know if this is a OCD thing? if i have a multitude of things on my mind or other milder worries i seem to be fine but when my brain is quiet and worry-less it seems i involuntary remind myself of the ''dissociative flashback'' which starts a cycle of psychological drowning and feelings of detachment as well as depressive feelings. this is all because of one thing in the past, my life would be 100x better if this was gone heck i would DO anything to get rid of this forever! meds have helped it occur less frequently but it is still the same severity.",1
"He turns it on first thing in the morning and turns it on the moment he gets home from work at night to play until midnight or later. Any free moment he has is spent playing this game. I'm a stay at home mom so I really look forward to talking to him, he's usually the only adult I talk to face to face during the week. Plus I love talking with him and spending time with him anyways, that's why I married him! Back when this all started, I told him that I needed him to spend more time with his kids and  I.",1
as a result hes put his hands on me. He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over. he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it. I honestly dont know if its true. Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
"Except now, the boyfriend's taken up drinking as he did before and has fallen back into his verbal and physically abusive habits. I'm not willing to take this anymore and I honestly fear for my safety when he has these psychotic mood swings. I have nowhere to go, though. No family or friends in this area and honestly, the area my family does live in was a ""living with druggies"" situation I do not want to be forced back into. I don't know what to do.",1
"I feel like I just keep digging a hole for myself, and its my fault I'm in there. With work I get emails about updates to projects and I usually these days don't reply, and submit what I have worked on minutes prior to my meetings. Which always results in a pissed off boss really. Then I feel even worse and my ocd comes back telling me that I'm a horrible person and everyone hates me. Its a weird tick, I don't know how to describe it.",1
"Over the past 6 years I've settled into a career that I'm really good at. Unfortunately I've had a slew of bosses that I had trouble dealing with. One of my biggest issues is that I'm prone to making small mistakes. They're not catastrophic, but they happen more often than I'd like. I've had supervisors that get really annoyed over these small mistakes, and they make me feel like my job is on the line.",1
"So I've recently started having anxiety attacks where it becomes hard to breathe, with the subject regarding many topics, mainly obsessing about relationships and government bureaucracies that I have to handle lately, and mainly where my life is going. I feel kind of lost. My spouse and I live in a war-torn country full of people trying to rip you off any chance they get, everyone is rude and generally don't fit the way I've been brought up, everything is expensive and the stress is beyond measure here. Not how we were brought up. We're waiting for me and her to finish college so we can get out of here and move to a civilized nation elsewhere.",1
"She Actually gave me 2 months to find a place to live before she was gonna kick me out but i couldn't find any and Friday is the last day of those 2 months.

Maybe i could buy a gun and shoot myself idk .",1
"It sorta works, but I don't like the feeling of being deadheaded. I also don't have a good relationships with doctors considering I was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen and given lithium... Had a terrible reaction to it. What are some more natural remedies or self-help you all do to keep yourself in the proper mindset to calm your triggers? I've started meditation and taking CBD oil (which work great, but kinda expensive), but it doesn't seem to be enough. I just want to start living and be able to enjoy life.",1

"Deep breathing, reminding myself that I'm just irrationally panicking, promising myself to take it step by step, analyzing the emotional baggage I've placed on this paper. For weeks now, it's been sitting on my computer, mocking me. It's late, and I'm slowly loosing motivation to even try. Can anyone help? I really want to try and edit the paper into something worth reading without feeling like I can't breathe.",1
"Someone elseâ€™s suffering ensued. I feel immense sadness and guilt now. I am confronted by the memories and the recognition that to this day the experience became part of who I am. It made me stronger, as facing fear and trauma can do. But I also internalized a sense of profoud fear and vulnerability.",1
"So I have been suffering from chronic anxiety for eight years.The kind where you feel some enemy is breathing down on your neck always.I don't want to get into the details of this matter because it's is very personal. But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up. Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years. During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis. So it seems to me this long chronic anxiety and the resulting hyperventilation and shallow breathing and high blood pressure did make my immune system rather weak or damaged.",1
"I do not want to hurt anybody. The therapist says it is self punishment, that I want these people to tell me what a piece of shit I am to verify what I already believe. But I never ever think of it like that at the time. I feel better if they are kind, and ambivalent or a tiny bit worse if they are cold and clinical. If it is unconscious, well I am getting sick of that idea.",1
"To make a long story short I suffer from anxiety, depression and PTSD due to past abuse since I was pretty young and recently had to move back home due to a traumatic event/mental health making it hard for me to survive on my own. This has made it very hard for me to be able to work/make money and support myself so my mother (being the kind woman she is) has helped out in feeding me but we're both low on food now and I feel horribly guilty and responsible. I'm trying every option I have out of desperation (this and a few other subreddits) and in the process of applying for assistance. Until then things are gonna be rough. If anyone can help out in ANY way I will really appreciate it.",1
"Mostly, I think I just want a mom. I've been struggling with anxiety really bad, and a lot of it has to do with my relationship with my boyfriend. This is my first boyfriend. He's a senior at a different college. He lives in the city that I go to school in.",1
And I'll get an intense feeling of impending doom. It lasts for less than a minute and then I'll fall back asleep. It usually happens during naps. I thought it was a seizure when it first happened. Has this happened to anyone else?,1
She thinks instead I should ask if I can read him how it has impacted me since this has happened. I don't know what to do. It's coming up so quickly and I'm feeling a twinge of anxiety as it gets closer. I keep telling myself I did everything I possibly could and that I should do what feels right to me even if it means I may feel like I'm going backwards at times. I also have to make a decision on if I want a permanent restraining order or a non violent contact order.,1
"I feel like one of my worst symptoms is nightmares. Not because they are overly terrifying, I don't wake up covered in sweat or out of breath. I just wake up feeling mentally and to a lesser degree physically exhausted. It just ruins my mood for the day and feels so hard to snap out of. I mostly just dream of killing my family and friends, or other random people, or people killing me or people dying.",1
Basically he makes too much money for help has no other family or friends to help I can barely help myself let alone my dad and his two dogs...but he has literally no where to go and he's gonna be homeless by the time he gets put of his house which he is being evicted from. His credit is too low to get a place and now with this eviction it will be harder. Also he lives on a fixed income which isn't to bad but it's still not gonna be enough to move in a month considering his credit history. I don't want my dad to be homeless....what can he do? Sorry if this doesn't apply to this group...idk what else to do...,1
"The verbal, emotions, and physical abuse continued I also believe in my heart that he cheated He left Facebook up on his computer with a conversation he had had with another ex about how much fun it was spending time with her(a day he had told me he was working late, couldn't even come up with an original lie)...it shattered me more, I didn't know my heart could break into any smaller pieces When she was three months old I told myself enough was enough... If he had shown even a glimmer of interest in his child or our marriage I could justify more time...but he didn't",1
"But I'm literally afraid of him because I feel like every second he's gonna stand behind me again and grunt at me that he changed something or completely rewrite my code. Plus, I don't know if maybe he is talking badly about me as well when I'm not there (it seems likely). What can I do?   ---   **tl;dr**: Coworker who is supposed to show me the ropes is super grumpy and I find him intimidating, can I do anything about this?",1
And he got angry at me. He was yelling at me about how it was an accident he just forgot and all I do is bitch. When we got to the store we didn't even go in because he said I ruined his mood or whatever and we just went home. I cried all day. I just can't do it anymore and I'm so depressed and I'm so scared that I will end up going back to him.,1
"Throwaway because this is an embarrassing issue (although everyone who knows me knows I have it). Iâ€™m sorry this is so long, I feel like I have no one to talk to about this and need to vent. I (21F) cry over the smallest things that I know I shouldnâ€™t cry over. I have always been like this even since I was little. Whenever I get in an argument with someone, I cry and it eats away at me.",1
The welfare office foe my county is too far and i can't get there without transportation to ask for help. I don't have any friends or family that can or are willing to take my cat and I.

Even though this is my fault because i'm an idiot.,1
"I have so much stress over money on a daily basis that sometimes itâ€™s nearly unbearable. As I mentioned, I have received some emergency assistance in the form of loans through /r/borrow, for which I am beyond grateful. But though they provide temporary relief, the loans themselves just end up being part of this vicious circle and mire me even deeper in the debt Iâ€™m trying to escape. I know more loans arenâ€™t the answer. So Iâ€™m looking for a different kind of help.",1
"My boyfriend is really understanding about everything, but he wants me to eventually come clean to my mother because he thinks that it's unhealthy for me to have to keep this from my mom. PLus he knows how bad I'm freaking out about it. My brother and my dad know but they can't tell my mom and they aren't much help in this situation, since my mother runs the house. For Christmas, my boyfriend bought me a hat, several CDs, and concert tickets. Irrelevant right?",1
"In a shame spiral, validation after asking feedback from peers, I'm over-reacting or too sensitive. Thank god my GF still loves me. I am in states of hypervigilance, catastrophizing, and hypersensitivity and it blows. Just needing to write this out, it helps. Thank you for reading.",1
"We talk about it a lot and we're on the same page on most of things.

"I'm livid....this only proves to me that you can't trust ANYONE not even your friggin therapist. She exploited me...pushing me to do this program wasn't to help me but she  did it for herself to try to get a raise, promotion or something. What should I do? I wrote an email to the administrator but I feel like I need to do more....I want the other participants of this program to be notified IMMEDIATELY that their sessions where they talk about very difficult/painful things, things that they don't like talking about, are being used for training purposes and God knows what else. Update: That asshole â€œtherapistâ€ was in fact promoted after pushing people to do this  dumb and unethical program...People that play dirty and use people get ahead.",1

"So Iâ€™ve been taking 40mg paroxetine for around 3 months (I donâ€™t go to her straight away) and have been fine until the past two weeks. Iâ€™m beginning to notice that my anxiety is again incredibly high a lot of the time. By listening to my body Iâ€™ve come to realise that caffeine is triggering me. NOW this is new. Iâ€™ve been drinking coffee since I was around 17 (22 now) and Iâ€™ve never had an issue (infact, it used to put me to sleep) but now whenever I have a coffee (French press at home or latte from a barista) within about 30 minutes I begin to shake and uncontrollably sweat.",1
"There is so much I can't do because I don't drive and it has impacted my life in such a way that it feels like I am in my own personal prison. I have been to therapy but it doesn't seem to work. So I am asking, have any of you overcome this situation? How did you do it? Any advice?",1
"Itâ€™s been a terrible struggle the last few years. We have never asked for help from anyone, though. We are hard working and we are proud of our family, and who we are as people. Itâ€™s hard to ask for help. BUT- sometimes WE need help too.",1
"I do have intense anxiety to the point it affects my daily life and prevents me from performing the smallest tasks such as making a phone call to get an appointment. However, I do not know if my anxiety is a result from what had happened to me as a child or me experiencing unpleasant experiences in highschool. I just know that my rape makes my anxiety worse sometimes. I do get triggered by anything that reminds me of unpleasant memories of my rape. The only time I break down is when I am severely distressed or my feelings are so bottled up that a trigger would set me off crying.",1
"I had another friend come out and tap on my window, scaring me. He didnâ€™t know what happened, and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry. I felt stupid and ashamed. Through the sobs I told him what happened, I even told him that my rapists did it to me. He was supportive and sweet and it made me feel so much more guilty.",1
"I've been trying to act like nothing happened but I can't stop thinking about all this. I feel weird that i'm even thinking about it so much. I should just brush it off. Everyone keeps telling me I should go for it. Even my guy friends, which I assumed would agree with me feeling gross about all this.",1
"Hi, I cannot think clearly today. I know I have to take care of myself, but its always been an issue. I do not shower, the last one was two months ago. I sleep in my clothes and wear them the next day. I do not was my hands, or face.",1
I don't need that. This sucks but is far from hopeless. I can do this with some help. The next bad thing came just two days out of the hospital. The lady who was letting me stay on her couch doesn't come home.,1
I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that. She asked me some basic questions and then suggested that I go into walk-in counseling that my school offers because she doesn't want to waste MY time being there. I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better. This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide. She acknowledged the fact that I wanted to stay and talk about other things in therapy but she proceeding to rush me out.,1
"Long story short, the alternator + module + radiator is going to cost $500 to repair. After bills are paid we only have $550 monthly for groceries and necessities. I cannot afford to pay this bill and a payday loan is out of the question because they charge a 300% interest and I cannot have that added bill to our already limited funds. Any help would be extremely appreciated. We have 2 kids and being without a car is really not easy.",1
"Hey guys, Been married for about a little over a year. I had an inkling before we got married that the wife was an anxious person but it was only after we got married I realised it was much more. She has weekly breakdowns over minor occurrences at work and comes home cursing and screaming about what goes on. (Not at me, but that repeated venting does have its toll on me as well mentally.",1
"I don't know whether to call the crisis team see if theyll stay on the phone as i leave to distract myself. Im determind not to be as agoraphobic as i was i will not be stuck inside trapped by myself. Yet here i am frozen in bed scared to leave in case it means i even start getting ready to go towards to front door. I know i should eat, but the anxiety part of me keeps trying to convince me i dont need to eat i'll be ok if i just stay inside safe.",1
"I feel like I cannot trust anyone. I truly feel that I have never felt any sort of platonic or romantic love. I still feel so much anxiety interacting with anyone, and especially those who show interest in me. W**d has been the one thing that helped me realize all of this. As you can imagine, however, my family is deeply opposed to this.",1
"I dont know what to do to be liked again, i guess it would be different if she had hated me from the beginning but that just isnt the case. She also hates my boyfriend and doesnt allow him anywhere near her house. I cant move because the rent is only $500 and I cant afford anything else, and yes, I do have a job. I've even asked her why she thinks I'm so stupid and she said ""because nobody taught you these things"" so I guess shes helping, it's just hard to know that I'm a failure. I try to meditate and to think very very very deep before I say anything, like to try and think of every outcome and if it might make her hate me more then I shouldnt say it.",1
"For the past couple months I have had really bad soreness and tightness in my upper back and neck. Sometimes it gets so stiff I can barely move my head. At first i thought it was a physical injury so I went to the doctors and had an xray but they could not find anything. I notice it flares up when im anxious. I have tried many self massages, creams, baths, pads, you name it.",1
"Hi guys! My close friend has been struggling lately to pay for her dog's surgery. Two months ago, she noticed a lump on her dog's leg. After running a few tests and getting several vet's opinions, the dog was diagnosed with Grade 2 soft tissue sarcoma. She had three options, do nothing, remove lump and go for chemo treatments, or amputate the leg completely.",1
"I decided to park behind it to see what their business was. They called 911 on me. I saw the copper stoppers coming and decided to pull in to my driveway, unload my kids and go inside while they dealt with the strange people. Well, the were there to deal with me! And one was walking up to question me while the other followed my children into my house!",1
"The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car, he would be home right now plotting his next scheme, but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance. The problem we face now, is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail), and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us, which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in. My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either. Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm. I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday, probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now, or will be soon.",1
"I was greeted by the message ""your Facebook account has been disabled...."" when I tried to log in couple of months back. I immediately sent an appeal and my ID proof from their forms but it's has been two months and no response from them. Basically the appeals are going to trash. This account was really important to me. Excluding family photos and memories, I owned couple of pages with huge fan following.",1
"I listen to him when heâ€™s having a bad day and thinking about what I did to him. I listen and try to say silent when he yells and screams at me. I take his insults in stride, as best as I can, because I feel like I deserve it. He tells me that he â€œhas no respect for meâ€ and I am â€œnothing but a mistakeâ€ and he tells me that I am trash, I do not deserve anything that I have, and that I am just a waste of his time. He tells me that he hates me.",1
"Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet. I started shaking, I couldn't lift my head up. My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke, and I told her the situation, the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity. But once we got back to our seats, I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms, just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people, but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer, she was a nurse. Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.",1
It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped. I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130  pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop. He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath. He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go. I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
"Sorry bad English Since almost 2 weeks now I've cut myself off every social interaction because I've been confronted to doubting and all that shit and I thought that was a necessary measure to take to reborn (trough introspection, my whole life since now is involved) and stop burst out of rage and being depressed from nothing And now I keep myself at the strict minimum of social interaction, 10 days that my daily conversation is limited at some words My mental health is decreasing I'm starting to struggle breath by the mouth, now I breath and speak with the nose (probably because I don't open it enough)",1

"I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep. I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnÊ»t want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnÊ»t want to compare my stress to that. Just wondering if itÊ»s possible that this is like mild ""anxiety"" or I am just sleep deprived? Also if its possible that anxiety can be come back after a decade of not having any noticeable events? Thanks ahead of time for any help.",1

"It's not a black nd white situation, I panicked, argued and a bunch over this with them, admittedly not helping my case, but I'm over that. I want help for my issues.  Enough sobbing, I sometimes feel so hopeless, but I need to remember that while I am down, I am not out. Employment, temporary housing, even just basic street smarts, I'd like to know how to cope with this situation. What to do, first 100 days and all.",1
"Hello. I am a thirty six year old man, and I became aware that the experiences I had, my behavior, and the expression of my feelings, may be BPD nine months ago, when I had my first suicide attempt. I had not read anything about it prior, and had entirely avoided any medical or mental health people. After the suicide attempt, which over nine years, head been preceded by the traumatic end of a highly dysfunctional five year relationship, followed by a severe four year alcohol problem. After getting out of the Psych ward after ten days, which I hadn't been in since an ideation incendent at seventeen, I determined to get help.",1
"These thoughts are always a great source of frustration to me especially when Iâ€™m close to an artistic deadline like a gallery exposition that is coming soon. Iâ€™m never confident enough to show what I do. Even the minister of culture in my country has made some very positive criticisms about it but my mind always goes back to thinking those people are only saying these things to be nice. Honestly, does anyone else feel that way? What do you do when this happens?",1
"He said he'd take me to my mothers house if I just smoked a cigarette with him. I did, but he refused to take me still. I continued fighting his hold and he kept saying my name in a gentle voice and telling me to calm down, saying that he loved me and didn't know why I was freaking out, and kept saying, ""you know you're not going to win. Go ahead, tire yourself out. You know you're not going anywhere.""",1
"I desperately need a car and found a great opportunity but the previous owner died of a heart attack in it. Thats my number one cause of anxiety, the fear of heart attacks. He was relatively healthy and young. I feel like a big idiot for not taking it. But I have vivid nightmares of me having heart attacks then I wake up with a panic attack that lasts hours.",1
"My friend made a comment that really embarrassed me because, up until that point, I hadn't realized how unusual it probably appeared. Since then, I've been more conscious of myself doing this and, while it feels like a shameful secret, I continue to do it. I know I never did this before, so I'm wondering if it has anything to do with what happened to me. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I feel like I'm the only one.",1
"I've been trying to avoid social media because I know how anxiety provoking it can be for me. I joined it ultimately because I thought it would make me feel more connected to people. It kind of does, which I'm okay with. But of course, now I'm looking at everyone's highlight reels and friend count (which I'm especially envious of) and I can't help but feel like crap. My social life came to a standstill in my early 20s when I compartmentalized all facets of my life, ensuring the people I knew never intermingled.",1
"He keeps saying he hates himself for this and won't let it happen again. I know he has a really big heart, so I don't know what to do. Is our relationship worth it? TL;DR My boyfriend of over two years has a huge drug problems and continuously lies to my face about it. He abuses them and it is effecting our relationship in a negative way.",1
"Iâ€™ve been in an abusive relationship for 3 years now. My family had stopped talking to me, and live states away when my boyfriend and I got together. The first time I noticed abuse was when he wanted to repeatedly have sex till I was sore, and would get angry if I refused. It was subtle at first but it scared me. As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasnâ€™t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldnâ€™t get out.",1
She was meeting her boyfriend (the one before my dad) because he was getting out of prison. Leaving my dad. So since my mom left you are probably thinking that the abuse stopped there huh? Unfortunately no. It was my dad's turn to use me as a punching bag.,1
"This has been affecting me for two weeks now, off and on. It's a combination of terrifying and annoying. Randomly throughout the day, I will notice that it feels harder to breathe and I take deeper breaths than normal. Air coming in almost feels like it has viscosity to it, like molasses, which makes me cough. Most of the time, I don't cough up anything so it's dry.",1
I got connected with the DV shelter in town to connect to my Crime Victim funds so I don't have to worry about therapy co-pays and I'm filled to the brim with anxiety about class tomorrow. I'm so tired of this. I hate that he probably witnessed me plunging into a panic attack. I hate that he saw that side of me. I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1
"I've stopped telling it,  and when someone at work says what's wrong. I just look at them and say its been a day. I just can't really go out and do stuff. I keep pushing college back I wanted to be a nurse and now I don't want to do anything but be a hermit and go live in the woods. I'm not really looking for responses I'm just tired of people not listening or believing me, I've had it all my life and I'm just done with it.",1

"Physical abuse wise my dad had beat me several times, I never really understood that it was abuse until not that long ago, things like hitting my legs together what seemed like as hard as he could, hitting me on the face as hard as he could, threatening to choke me out, etc. it overall made me feel pretty disassociated, I just didn't really understand why though, my relationship with my parents became this extremely hollow thing that felt like an obligation rather than having genuine parents. as I got older from 10 on they became increasingly mentally abusive on top of it, at age 11 my dad found out that I'm trans by looking on my computer and screamed at me for an hour and threatened to hospitalize me (He didnt know mental hospitals wont hospitalize people for it, and might've ended up trying to put me into conversion therapy or something) this is around where my mental health completely snapped, going into 7th grade, hitting age 12, I started becoming extremely suicidal, I thought about hanging myself at school or stabbing myself, it became too much to bear, not being able to be openly trans, being beaten, feeling on edge non stop, feeling completely invalidated to the core of who I am as a person. I became morbidly depressed and stayed that way from then on.",1
"First post here, using a throwaway because for some reason I just don't want my regular reddit account attached, despite being fairly open about the fact I was raped. But I digress. In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with. I was diagnosed with PTSD in September. The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.",1
And I don't even remember. Please help me. He says it's ok and he forgives me. But it's NOT OKAY. my diagnoses and the symptoms of it is never an excuse to hurt the ones I love.,1
"This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him. I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel. Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking. This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!",1
"He wants me to study abroad in Europe after undergrad, then return and work for the government in economics. I don't mind the Europe part, but I have zero interest in working for the government and am absolutely shit at economics and I've told him so. No matter how many times I express my lack of interest, qualification, or skill at economics, he ignores me and continues to push this path. It wasn't like this was something he's pushed on me my whole life - it's like he came up with this plan for me when I  turned 18, and now is obsessed with it. I really don't know what to do.",1
"I need some advice here. I'm not sure if my insecurities have run wild or if I'm justified in thinking my boyfriend is being out of line. He met this girl through friends who set them up and for their first date they went jogging. Weird, I know, but it's her hobby and he wanted to get into it. They'd never met before this.",1
"At the same time, Iâ€™ve been going crazy because if Iâ€™m not thinking about something else Iâ€™m thinking about him and various kink related acts. This isnâ€™t anything Iâ€™ve actually experienced before (hell, I still donâ€™t get attraction), so Iâ€™m confused. My issue is, heâ€™s going back overseas for uni in a couple of days, and weâ€™ll be seeing each other (in our larger group) tomorrow. Should I bring something up? Should I just leave it?",1
"For the rest of the 7 years, Iâ€™ve received different forms of violent punishments. I donâ€™t want to get into it but they involved sharp objects, attempts to drown me, paddling, etc. I was generally OK growing up, didnâ€™t think about the abuse a lot, but friends started noticing strange behaviors and phobias that I cannot hide. Now at 30 years old I went to a therapist. I found out that my behaviors are probably caused by suppressing my memories and not finding proper closure from the incident because itâ€™s as if Iâ€™m still taking the blame for an abuse that was done to me.",1
"But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment. Just having this idea people hate me when they donâ€™t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism. Not that he deserves it.

So now I just stay home and go on my computer all day. I leave the house maybe twice a week. I have constant feelings about being useless and that I'd be better off dead.",1
"He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better. And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up. Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together. I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?"" keeps returning.",1
"Three months of this and talking with the one friend whom I could call for free between 9pm and 6AM due to AT&T's GoPhone policies whenever I could get away with it, or texting on a Nokia Tracphone (the ancient indestructible brick phone), and my sister lashing out at me about being ungrateful that they allowed me to come over and use the internet, triggered by my snapping back due to, something, I can't remember, and I just, stopped asking. Ended up losing contact with everyone but the one friend I could talk to maybe, once or twice a week for a couple hours. She'd try to keep me apprised of stuff going on with folks, and those phonecalls ended up bring the spark that bloomed into us being a couple, but... It wasn't enough. The same negativity, the same feelings of selfhatred, of self-disgust, of ***believing*** everything my father had dumped on me slowly took over.",1
"I went to hang with friends for a movie night and it was wonderful. But damn, I felt really inferior. My friends are branching off and doing amazing things, and I feel Iâ€™m in the corner just trying to make it through the day, constantly dealing with chronic pain, low immunity, and PTSD. Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of therapy work around traumas I have experienced as a child, and thatâ€™s been good but also really hard. Iâ€™m just having a rough time tonight.",1
"The rare times we have fought in the past, Iâ€™ve always had to be the one to â€˜break the ice,â€™ regardless of the circumstances of the argument. I donâ€™t have it in me to go grovel for the comfort I sorely need. Now Iâ€™m just trying to cry myself asleep. Whatâ€™s the point of having a partner if they canâ€™t offer the most basic level of emotional support?

"So earlier today I was suffering from extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety. So what I did is I let the thoughts free and whenever I got a tnhoguht I ignored it and I think I just suppressed my anxiety deep down.

Once she goes into an anxiety spiral I'm completely at a loss of what to do apart from hold her and stroke her hair. What strategies can help break the spiral when she starts one, and how can I approach the topic of seeing a counsellor and developing mindfulness strategies without her going into a panic attack? Help me /r/anxiety, you're my only hope.",1
"I went there on autopilot, I was blank inside and I was ready to jump. My counsellor saw me through the window and called me on the phone, trying to distract me so she could send help over to me. Campus was pretty much empty, everyone in exams or already finished for the summer and I felt at peace. I was gently talked away from the edge by campus security and they took me to see my counsellor. I havent seen her since this happened and Im due back at uni next week.",1
"Some examples: spit on me randomly in the eye doctor's office, giggled and strolled off when I looked up at him in horror. We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow. And he would often have a gleeful look on his face after he was done. For the longest I didn't know this was abuse, nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused. He ruined my life without me even being aware.",1
"Theyâ€™re out of town. I live in a pretty safe neighborhood, so I left the door unlocked for 30 minutes while I went on a run earlier. I always do that. Now Iâ€™m wishing I didnâ€™t. Called two of my friends, but itâ€™s late and theyâ€™re asleep.",1
"Anyway our talk basically went nowhere and she said she absolutely will not stop hanging out with the group. I didnâ€™t tell her to, but I did tell her that it hurts me that she would engage with people who apparently have so many negative things to say about me, and I thought blood was thicker than water. Really itâ€™s her callous â€œyea I see youâ€™re in pain but I donâ€™t care, get over itâ€ type of standpoint thatâ€™s hurting me the most. Iâ€™m starting to think she too participates in the trash talking and Iâ€™m thinking of cutting her off too. Should I?",1
But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now. I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships. I feel bad for my boyfriend- he shouldn't have to put up with this stuff. I know he loves me and he is terribly worried. But I also feel bad for me.,1
"He brought me to hang out with the two of them a few times. I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about. My best guess is that my ""touchy"" ness comes off as flirting and he thinks I'm trying to take him from her? I do casually say things like ""I love you"" a lot too which just worsens it from that perspective. This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.",1
"For the dog, at least, I can get stuff for cheap dog food or something, but the cat we'd need cat food. All of this weighs on my mind. With my anxiety, I keep going over it in my head again and again. I know I need to see a therapist, but you guessed it, no money. I'm really hoping someone can help out.",1
"I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not, and I feel guilty for feeling relieved. We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years. My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault. Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me. Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.",1
I didnâ€™t sleep that night and eventually was fine. Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer. Iâ€™ve had a few mini panic attacks. I canâ€™t get intoxicated anymore Bc I donâ€™t like my mind being In a different state. I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time.,1

It was a freezing cold night i remember. Ge had tried calling for our Lab to no avail as our lab was exploring down the road. My father (i hate saying that!) Started getting very angry, furious even.",1

I think the reason we get by is because sometimes we can get away with once a day torture from my mother, she also helps us a lot (especially me) and some days are ok. He just feels harassed and I understand this more than anyone because I feel the same way. .",1
"I hide my own set of keys. She tries to take her keys away from me and I refuse, which turns into a full-blown fight. I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back, as well as deep scratches from her fingernails. At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand. I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
"The thought of leaving my folks behind would definitely not be good for me mentally. I've thought about basically living out of my car, gym memberships to shower daily and laundromats to wash my clothes. Perhaps put all my stuff in storage and just keep working and save some money up. I live on long Island btw. Rent isn't cheap.",1
"Which forced me to acknowledge that I havenâ€™t been performing to my own expectations. Enter the anxiety attack. Sobbing, shaking, fidgeting, and rambling. To top it all off, I threw away my xanex thinking that I didnâ€™t need the safety net. I thought I was done with all this...reality proved otherwise.",1
"I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure Iâ€™m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such. Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when Iâ€™m off. Even when Iâ€™m off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though Iâ€™m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like thereâ€™s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still donâ€™t do MORE because Iâ€™m normally too tired to do anything else.",1
"I was nice, and it got me no where, so I was rude, it got worse. I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can, I tell my sister Iâ€™m proud of her, I tell both of them I love them, I take care of my mom the best I can, but Iâ€™m still their verbal punching bag. Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with â€œyouâ€™re gonna fail this year you know that right? You need to do your school workâ€. My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of peopleâ€™s interests and looks.",1
"Please don't make me feel worse. I mean, hell, I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend. But at least we have things to talk about and he's just naturally good at keeping me calm without even realizing he's doing it. He actually *helps* by being there. My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.",1
"1. My father would abuse me consistently both mentally and physically from i think 4 to 14, maybe earlier. I don't really remember what all brought this on, but often it was school related. I remember being in a car seat, my mother didn't know what to do so she took me to him (my parents are apart), and i tried to run because i knew what was going to happen, and i remember crying so hard i hyperventilated, my mom promised never to do that again. He'd do it because of grades, because i misbehaved.",1
"I tell her this, which falls on deaf ears. Next day, we go to work things out. And I freak out when staff at the library call cops over us ""being loud"", I freak out over some very minor warrants. Which leads to her disappearing untill today when we have a meeting with a councilor. While waiting & the drop in center for the shower she assaults me & I block her blows.",1
"A LARGE portion of each of my check goes to making payments to this card but with the interest charges each month I budgeted and itll take me decades to pay it off and cost me thousands. I was in a tough spot, jobless, homeless, and had to rely on the card but now I need to find options on how to pay it off or get a lower interest rate. I have heard of those advertisements about taking out a personal loan with a lower rate and using that to pay off the card then just paying the personal loan off, are those viable options? What is my best option right now, these interest rate charges are killing me and I can barely make ends meet. Any advice would be deeply appreciated",1
"im so scared of everything around me, whenever I have a panic attack, I can't even call out for help, I just choke on my own breath and cry im just fearful of what's going to happen in the future. I'm already seeing a therapist but i've been relapsing so bad since september and i just don't know what to do it's been such a rollercoaster and it just feels hopeless to recover from this im sorry for bothering you guys i just need to talk.. everyone i can talk to is asleep and i wouldnt be able to talk to them even if I could, i feel so numb after the panic attack i had last night, i just.. Need a talk, a distraction or something, because right now I just feel so. wrong and out of place",1
"Hey guys, I'm 31, moved to a new city with my wife for the first time back in October, and am experiencing on and off anxiety for more or less the first time in my life. A couple quick questions: 1. How do I know whether I should see a psychologist or a psychiatrist?",1
"At least 20 Ritalin 30mg maybe more (I've learned how to take many at once over the years of daily medication). I don't remember everything but i tried to lie to him and he had to drag me to the bathroom and tried to make me throw up. After a bit i realized what i was doing and tried myself. It didn't work. The scary thing is that when he went to call the ambulance and i thought i just might die i repeated to myself ""It's finally over"".",1
"Clearly he's hurting inside and I want to get him help, but he refuses to get help because he denies he has a problem, and blames it on everyone else. He then punches me as a result of this, pushing me almost off my chair. I get up and push him away from me, and so he picks up my workbooks and flings them across the floor. He raises his fist above his head, and in defense I get the broomhead (not the broom - that's already been broken) to push him away from me. He then gets the broomhead and throws it down the corridor into my room with the door open.",1
"I'm soo lucky/blessed that I have parents with an open home to me so that I am able to do this but I can't keep going on like this. I feel afraid to work. I feel like less of a man because of this. I worry about my future and if I'll ever get stable ground. Sorry, I needed to put my thoughts into text.",1
"He came home from who knows where and he walks in. I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried. He was mad, i could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice. Next thing i knew he was behind me with his arm around my neck squeezing. He continued as he threw me on the couch and wrapped his legs around my stomach.",1
I wonder about that night. Did you ever get past that night? Did you have other nights like that? Did anyone ever ask if you were okay? Do you forgive me?,1
"I thought theyâ€™d give me another date to come back or put me on probation but that did not happen. They told me I wouldnâ€™t be allowed back to my house until my court date in a MONTH. And even that is certain. Well I found a friend that I can stay with for another 2 days but after that Iâ€™m unsure of what to do. Iâ€™m currently unemployed donâ€™t even have a license, thereâ€™s literally no one I can stay with my parents are refusing to talk to me.",1
"I don't have any point, I'm just overwhelmed and want to give up. No one's going to read this long of a post anyway. I don't want to tell my therapist, I don't want to go to therapy. It feels artificial and contrived and uneven. When I google all this shit the internet is like ""That's the ptsd talking.""",1
"Today was a horrible day from the get go and I had to call out because I cant function with other people (I work in retail) today so I claimed I had a fever. Of course it had to be memorial day weekend making it one of the worst times for this and they even of course said over the phone ""Well, this really puts us in a bind"". Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this. I'm so paranoid I'm worried they'll see me or come to my house to check on me even though I know they would never do that. I just wish someone could understand or sympathize/empathize with me for once.",1
"It's sick and twisted. I've been getting nauseas and I've been having more dissociative flashbacks. My nightmares are coming back, but they're mostly of his parents. I'm afraid to see them, although my dreams are usually them telling me they understand. That they're not mad at me for going to the police.",1
"We've talked about it before and she said that it's not like that and she cares about me alot and all that, but at the same time these type of things keep happening. I truly feel that she does care and doesn't mean to neglect me but its just frustrating. If I keep saying something I'll look like a bad guy thats trying to ruin her friendships which is not what i'm trying to do. She's going to tell her friends what I say and they're probably going to think i'm trying to get her away from them.   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend is having trouble balancing friendship and relationship",1
"A few weeks later, i found out that he had had a long term girlfriend the entire time. I felt like such an idiot when I found out. He reached out to me last month and I told him I knew he had a girlfriend the whole time and that if I ever saw him again I would literally break his nose. I'm still furious about it. I'm angry that he thinks he pulled one over on me and that he got away with it.",1
"Trauma changed the trajectory of my life. But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded. My ex and I broke up because he never liked to leave the house, even for daytime activities. I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age. Am I going to feel like I do now?",1
"If I ask her anything about her life or about my uncle who she lives with (66 stroke survivor), she answers vaguely â€œHeâ€™s fineâ€ or â€œask him yourselfâ€. The unappreciative part come from the fact that when she asks me to do something and I have to say no, or if I imply a no, she gets completely mad at me. Sheâ€™ll go â€œbut I love you and do stuff for you. Your daddy would be disappointed in you. Fine, then, Iâ€™ll never ask for anything ever again.",1
"But how do I keep going with this girl and eventually ask her to hang out again because no romantic relationship can really progress forward until we're physically intimate with each other, but we can't get there unless we hang out. And she doesn't even like talking on the phone and just texts. I feel like I'm having a relationship with my phone sometimes and it's like a female Wilson sometimes lol (movie Castaway reference for those who don't know). Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship and came out of it or anyone who dated an abused survivor, how do you advise that I progress things with her? \*\*TL;DR\*\* I'm dating a girl who was formerly in an abusive relationship.",1
it wasn't my fault it feels like my fault I feel like the reason That mother shouldn't have had to bury her boy I should have been a better friend,1
"Every day I hope she messages me, calls me, or post on my Facebook. Any advice would mean the world to me. Thank you.   ---   **tl;dr - can't get over my ex**: How to get over my ex!",1
"But then i couldn't think straight. now i get flashbacks in school. I used to enjoy quantitative courses but now i get tension headaches from the flashbacks, and feelings of horror and hyperarousal. I just feel so violated and disturbed that it was for fear of his violence that i didn't close the door - and that he was watching me! My vagina feels tension too, which i read from a PTSD book is a common symptom.",1
"They would text and call constantly throughout the day begging me to forgive them for hurting me but that  they're in love and love can't be stopped. They got increasingly angry and started calling me selfish for trying to keep them apart. After I wrote a bit about the sexual abuse in an anonymous online diary my ex (who knew my username but I thought I had blocked from the site) started harassing me more. Angrily telling me that I need to stop pretending he raped me and how I wanted everything that happened and that I was just a jealous ex. I won't and kinda can't (remember missing pieces of time) go into all the details, but he gaslighted me pretty bad.",1
"This has *obviously* created some crushing tension in the apartment, with no one really having to go other than work during the day. (We've all recently moved to the area and don't really have family/mutual friends to stay with.) Flash forward to last night...I'm asleep on the couch and she comes in at 1AM, blackout drunk, shakes me awake violently to tell me of the Tinder date she just got back from and how awful it was. But the guy she had sex with last night was pretty good, etc. This goes on and on, turns to threats of violence against me for uprooting and throwing her life into whack.",1
"Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it. I don't know for how long but it can't be for more than 10 minutes. I just found out about catatonia and I show a few other symptoms. When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else. I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this, am I just looking too deep into things?",1
"I have no worth or identity or breathe. He has blamed me for everything. I guess I am getting an abortion. I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves, and even though it was just a second it really hurt me. He hides me from his friends and his friends reject me but all he says is I do not like his friends.",1
"Friends privy to the situation believe that she is just constantly keeping me on the back burner because I'm the safe option, when she isn't with somebody, or when she doesn't have anybody else. She knows I love her still, she knows I'd do just about anything for her, and want to be with her still to this day but nothing more than just an option. I always end up feeling the same in this situation though, worthless, low, wishing I was in a relationship with her.   ---   **tl;dr**: Me and ex have stayed in somewhat constant contact for 10 years, never get back together officially.",1
"I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger. I notice it sticks around even when I feel emotionally calm and can stick around for a long time after the trigger, like days or weeks. Itâ€™s a new symptom I think. Also been having lots of nightmares again recently. Not sure what to do as Iâ€™m not currently in therapy, but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.",1
"I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I canâ€™t slee because of them. These periods last for weeks or months on end and then stop briefly. Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I canâ€™t remember the name though. It was a really old blood pressure medicine from the fifties that they gave to soldiers returning from war and they figured out that it helped with ptsd too. But it made me so tired.",1
"I've applied to many other places over the months and using services like Indeed and Monster. But no such luck as of yet. The whole issue has left me feeling angry. When I talked to my therapist about it, he did help; however, the conversation had the tone of ""being a man"" and doing what you need to do and after a while to simply let go of the anger. I'm not trying to disregard him, but I've been having a hard time understanding what he means.",1
"I suffered a concussion a month ago and I noticed it really has provoked my anxiety to be scared about getting worse and it has even led to me getting depressed and thinking of harming myself I have been like this before, I have had anxiety but not to this level. I have felt better since the concussion has healed but I am worried I won't recover from my anxiety and I have been perscribed Celprix (Escitalopram) and unsure if I should take it. I kind of feel like I can recover from this by getter back to my routine and return to work. Anyone else been through a life changing injury and had some bad anxiety from it?",1

"We've been living in my grandmother's house since loosing the apt. All of our possessions, as well as all of my grandmother's possessions were in the home at the time of the fire. The property was supposed to be sold on December 29th, but when my cousin who was also living on the property unexpectedly passed away on December 24th, the buyers backed out. Due to these circumstances, our home insurance had lapsed, so at the moment we have no resources to work with, except for the generosity of others. It's a massive tragedy for our family, because we didn't have any funds available for Christmas either, and between family, and friends, we were able to have a great holiday, but now all of those gifts are gone as well.",1
I don't know what to do with myself ! At times I feel like just killing myself. but I have been thinking that for a couple of years now so thats not happening. .  About a month ago I chose to go homeless because I was stuck.,1
"Unfortunately, money is what me and her don't have now. My friends' help has dried up, and I don't blame them one bit for that. After five months, I've exhausted pretty much all the friends I can. Going into every little thing that has happened could fill a book. Maybe I \*WILL\* write a book about it someday, I don't know.",1
"This post was spurred by the fact that I was just scrolling through photos I took of my boyfriend last year and I found myself thinking, ""is this person actually my boyfriend?"" I don't mean that in a sappy ""how did I get so lucky"" way (although I did luck out with him, for sure) but more in a ""how do I see this person all the time and still feel like I don't recognize him in photos"" way. We've been together for over five years. It just... it doesn't make any sense. Normally I only do this with people from high school, many of whom I haven't seen since we graduated six years ago.",1
He hasn't paid any child support. He isn't fulfilling the courts orders that would get him a chance to petition for supervised visitation. It feels like he's completely just disappeared from being a father but I still feel like he's going to come back. Even writing about it makes it hard to breathe. Is it silly?,1
"and ""how could you let me do this?"" Although my family and friends will never see this, I'm here to answer the question: ""why?"" It wasn't as simple as some of my friends may think. I didn't magically wake up one day and think ""You know what, I think I'll let my abuser walk me down the aisle."" It's taken 5 years for me just to sit across from him and have dinner without having a full blown panic attack.",1
"My version of events wasn't believed due to ten other witnesses denying it and I was expelled immediately. I got home and unexpectedly my bags were already packed. My sister-in-law walked up to me, gave me an insincere hug, and said ""Your actions have consequences. You're going to Portland two weeks early."" I asked if I could say goodbye to my nieces and nephews and friends and she said ""no.""",1
"He ended up grabbing me by the neck with both hands and slamming my head against the wall in the hallway, he threw me the ground I hit the radiator and then he threw a bucket at me that had a toy and DOG SHIT in it (i genuinely don't think he knew there was dog shit in it, he just threw whatever was there...and our dog must have shit in it.) I didn't pass out this time. He went upstairs and slammed his door and locked it. I got right up and ran up the stairs and told him to let me in to get my shit so I can go. He told me to leave and I started kicking the door and demanding he lets me into get my shit so I can go.",1
"That freaked me out. I was tired after probably from a sugar crash and I immediately assumed I was going through a calcium OD and was going to end up in a coma. Then I went home and opened a Snapchat and got deja vu (I thought I read that Snapchat before). I experience deja vu like that frequently, and googled it and it said I could have a brain condition or epilepsy... If Iâ€™m going to have to live like this forever sometimes I wish I wouldnâ€™t wake up.",1
"Apparently with this new technology, my entire phone shuts down for 5 minutes after making an emergency call. I'm waiting to tell work about what happened, that I can't come in. I'm going to the hospital with her. I don't care if they're mad or if I get fired. I just feel so shaken and scared still.",1
"My anxiety caused me to become independent and cold towards him, but inside I was screaming. All I wanted was for him to hold me and tell me everything was fine. But my anxiety got the best of us and caused a rift. We broke up for a week and then when we got back together we were really good for maybe a month or two and the same insecurities slipped in. Mind you, he has NEVER cheated or even acted interested in other girls.",1
"I feel like I've taken a giant step back. I'll address this in my next counseling session, but does anyone know if this sort of reaction is common during a recovery process? TL/DR: Abusive relationship led to a violated protection order. The subsequent criminal trial has made me question my emotional stability, and memories. Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis, or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?",1
I wish I could go back and just not fuck up so horribly. I was begged not to go out on this date from tinder. My friend was raped off tinder and told me all guys want are sex off tinder. I had talked to my assaulter and told him I didn't want to be touched and he was fine with it and seemed perfectly normal. I'm so stupid.,1
"Every morning I wake up and it's there on the exact same spot. This has been happening for the past 4 days and I thought I need to reach out to someone if they can help me at all? I have convinced myself I have a brain tumour, I keep feeling dissociated and completely out of it I keep touching the same spot on my head like every 20 seconds like a compulsion and it's really getting me down. When I swallow i feel as if i can feel a pulling sensation near the spot where this is happening. It's not exactly giving me a headache but it's disturbing me to which i notice it.",1
This is my story I feel I should share in the case things every turn bad. When I was a kid my brother use to practice the choke slam. At first it was fun but when I grew up it wasn't. My brother continue to abuse me for years . He called me names and some days I believe him.,1

"Now like I said, I am working hard to try and get a better job while balancing school (the good grades I've gotten in the past year and a half seem to be only things I have going for me right now. That and martial arts) and at the same time, I'm considering asking for another shift at my current job as an absolute last resort. But this anger and feeling like a loser is really something I need help dealing with. Tl;dr: My car died once and for all a few months back and my job sucks. And even though I'm working hard to improve the situation, I feel angry and I feel a like a loser.",1
"I used my forearm to push the plate I was eating from off the counter. A glass bowl fell to the floor as well and shattered. The noise woke my dad up, who went to bed nearly black out drunk a couple hours before this. He immediately started screaming at my friends to â€œget the fuck outâ€ and aggressively pushing them out of the back door. He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling â€œtake her fucking ass with you.â€ My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.",1
Nobody should ever have to put up with that and have to live in fear of someone who can fly off the handle like that. I wish so badly I knew who she was so that I could tell her in quiet that if she ever needs a place to escape that my door is always open. Sorry for my rambling. I'm just not sure what to do or how to approach this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.,1
"I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist, and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization. And I'm so tired of it. I've been in therapy for half of my life. I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough. So I started talking to myself (which I do under stress) and drinking and this was a piece of the conversation:",1
"I feel like I'm letting this take over my life, I'm constantly worried, about what if is more then just anxiety. I went to the university psychiatrist, after a 15 min talk he gave some pills and he book the next consultation for a mouth later. The psychologist is impossible to book because is full. My parents are away they worry so much,  they want me to come home,  I live 5 hours away from them (this includes flying). I just don't know, I feel really insecure about all of this.",1
"My bank didn't notify me at all, though a lot of the transactions happened outside the country. I currently have about $8 to my name from my savings, which has since been overdrawn.

People effortlessly walk all over her, and though she gets mad about it, company policy as well as her personal precedence, has really tied her hands.

"I know itâ€™s terrible and selfish and obviously people can be friends with each other but I just miss having a really strong and healthy friendship with another girl the way that we did. I want to have a good weekend but it feels impossible now, and I want everyone there to have a good weekend and I donâ€™t want to make it bad. I donâ€™t know what to do. So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself. Itâ€™s just I want to be better, not just for other people but for myself too.",1
"I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today. That was the scariest part. It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. I know most of you will say â€˜you need to leaveâ€™ or something obvious - yes I know. But things arenâ€™t that easy and than thereâ€™s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1
"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",1
"I thought we had an open door, honestly policy about our hook ups, but last week found out he'd made out with a few people during our relationship that I didn't know about. I got hit by a wave of how incompatible we are and tried to break up with him but I realised I was being a hypocrite and letting my insecurities control me and I mended things. ANYWAY, onto the issue. I had a pretty scary time with a friend of mine last night. He invited me around for a few beers, and maybe two drinks in he asked if I'd be down to have sex.",1
"He knows that I'm still on the fence about pot and, without me even asking, promised me that he would not do it. But, last March while he was gone, he got extremely drunk and ended up smoking. He got extremely sick and ended up vomiting and passing out on the bathroom floor of their bus, and called me the next day and told me everything. This was extremely difficult for me to process. I couldn't really understand how something that he swore off doing he just... ended up doing.",1
"Long story short: Worked in a call centre for 4 years for a vehicle breakdown service, starting to not be able to cope with it any more due to a combination of things (change in management, not enough staff for a constantly expanding customer base, rewards based on whether your face ""fits"" rather than actual demonstrable achievements, etc). Unable to relax after work, constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it, either intensely rageful, or wanting to burst in to tears. Headaches that go on for 3 or 4 days at a time are now a regular occurence. Starting to manifest in other physical ways (unable to sleep, constantly weary, having a lot more sickness than usual).",1

Iâ€™ve received hundreds of harassing contacts from him and heâ€™s even tried to extort my friendship back by threatening to expose sex tapes. Iâ€™ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together. Iâ€™ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far. Iâ€™ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart. Iâ€™ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,1
"I (30F) married my husband (31M) about 6 months ago after dating for 2 years and knowing each other for about 14. When we first hooked up, I had a very successful career in the adult industry and I supported him for almost 2 years before he got a job. He knew what I did before we hooked up because I had been in the industry for years and everyone back home knew. He told me multiple times that he accepted it and he loved me regardless. However, He has been very abusive, always blaming it on my job before and now that I have retired since our marriage he uses my past against me during every fight.",1
"I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him. To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him. I almost died twice thanks to him. I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly. I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.",1
"Iâ€™m trying to tell myself itâ€™s like being beat up on the street by a stranger - itâ€™s only once, but it still happened and itâ€™s traumatic. 2) Related to the above. It WASNâ€™T a stranger. It was someone I loved and trusted and I canâ€™t believe he could have done this. He never treated me right, not truly (except maybe in the very beginning), but I never even saw this as a possibility.",1
"He forced me into sex again... And if I refused he became violent. Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough, and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor. When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe... I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets. If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...",1
"So I'm currently in a decision if I suffer from social anxiety or not. If I can I will ask ny step mom tonight as we like to watch TV at night diwn stairs with a cuo of tea but thats if she doesn't go to bed straight away. I know I'm too scared and will just freeze up to ask her to stay down. I want to tell my step mom because I know she will tell my dad, I wouldn't be able to tell anyone else accept for my nan. I'm in a really tough situation right now as I want to see a doctor or therapist about this but I need to tell someone first.",1
Is it normal to feel hopeless and scared that i won't find love again? tldr: got cheated on a bunch and dumped because i cried on Christmas due to a breakdown re: being cheated on all the time and feeling worthless. scared about finding love in the future. Apologies for the mess. I've been talking myself out of writing this for a couple weeks now.,1
"ItÊ»s at the point where I am scared I canÊ»t focus on driving and will crash or just space out going 45 mph. In the past Ive had 3 major ""panic attacks(?)"" where my whole body is in pins and needles and I canÊ»t breathe well but they were all triggered by major emotional events. I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep. I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnÊ»t want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnÊ»t want to compare my stress to that.",1
"And they all make it sound like I will have infinity free time and money to go exploring all over where I'm going, like I'm going on a damn vacation. I'll still be spending all my free time job hunting. If they want me to come right back to a shithole that doesn't want to hire me because I'm supposedly overqualified just by existing (I keep getting rejections telling me I'm overqualified except for the one that asked me to fill out yet another application despite me handing them one two weeks ago), maybe they can pay my way and then they can pay for all the months that I don't have income. I have come back here too many times already to nothing, and they seem to think I'm just hanging around having fun living in my car. Unbelievable.",1
"""What is nothing is real? What if everything is a figment of your imagination?"" I panicked, and grabbed the couch, but the voice inside me said ""It doesn't matter if you grab the couch, what is the couch isn't real? What if your house isn't real?"" At this time I called my brother, sobbing, and told him to get my mom.",1
I'm assuming I have PTSD and my work gave me a number to call and I'm debating doing so. But I hate asking for help and I feel pathetic because nothing happened. I'm physically fine. I just really need advice because I'm struggling on how to feel. I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1
"Back ground, me and my girl have been homeless independently for about a year and we've been together for six months now. We lived in Olympia Washington for a while and where trying to make it and eventually move out of the toxic town. I received about 3.5k$ worth of back pay EFC payments the state owed me and shortly after my girl's grandmother died and she wanted to make it to the funeral so we decided to make a road trip of it, get jobs in florida and be set. We figured the lower cost of living would offset the vastly lower minimum wage and we'd be fine. We both got jobs at her old workplace (Wendy's, never go to the Lakeland Highlands Wendy's so many healthcode violations btw) and worked for two months and got fired for bs reasons (I got trained wrong and wasn't told about 60% of my responsibilities by a guy who was on his phone 75% of the time and quit a week later, she overslept and no call no showed one day and got immediately taken off the schedule)",1
"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident. This new person I'm dating has never done anything wrong, but I had a thought of what they would look like holding a knife. It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head. I don't want the event from my previous relationship to have an impact on the potential of this new one. Does anyone have any advice for breaking free from this sort of thing?",1
I don't want to feel like a burden to anyone anymore and to myself so the feeling of wanting to die didn't go away. I don't know how to deal with myself or with other people since I feel like I should just get over it and continue with my life but I can't and I'm 22. Am I exaggerating? Am I just so weak that I can't deal with what happened to me that I can't normally continue with my life? I was a good student and a good friend.,1
"I keep alternating between crying, laughing, and freaking out. I'm also really upset right now and my boyfriend isn't making me feel better. He keeps saying things like, this is all your fault and no one is making you think these things. And to be patient with things.... I feel like this is going to kill me?",1
I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here. I bawl every night because I don't want to feel this never ending pain anymore. I can't live with what happen to me. I can't live with the fact that since I didn't go to police that he is preying on another girl like me. I have so many social problems I dont have friends anymore.,1
"Iâ€™m so concerned as we head into warmer months. I know I need to leave the area and thatâ€™s on my agenda, I just canâ€™t do that before summer comes and goes. I am currently trying to come up with ways to manage my day to day life. Working from home, not venturing outside as much as possible. But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour.",1
"Why am I feeling like I miss him.. Iâ€™ve been okay for 7 damn days & then he texted my grandmother & asked me if I wanted him to mail me my stuff (a card) & now Iâ€™m starting to feel bad. Why is he seeming so decent now... Why do I feel so damn guilty.. why do I feel like I did something wrong. He hasnâ€™t tried to do anything harmful to me, the only thing heâ€™s been asking about is our children as expected.. But Iâ€™ve been ignoring him. Why do I feel like Iâ€™m in the wrong.",1
"My heart is palpitating because I finally responded in a group chat that I'm not so active in because I'm scared nobody is going to care what I say. So I finally responded this morning because the chat seems active and it couldn't possibly hurt right? I'm trying to beat my anxiety. Well, my fears were confirmed. Nobody responded to what I texted.",1
"I always feel like no one actually likes me and they just put up with me out of pity. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle, because that insecurity makes me more self-conscious and standoffish, which makes me more unlikeable. I just feel like Iâ€™m nothing but a drain on everyone and an inconvenience. Iâ€™m constantly plagued by these thoughts about what a terrible person and I am, and itâ€™s just so exhausting. I wish I was normal.",1
"I have an appointment with a paralegal to draw up a separation agreement. When I tell him I want and am filing for a separation and divorce, he will ask why. Do I mention to him about finding the extent of their chats and the cellphone bills? What about the disappearing IM accounts? Or do I just leave it at ""You had an affair, you aren't being completely honest with me about it, I feel like this 'reconciliation' we are experiencing is just me being strung along till you get your pieces in place to leave.",1
She gave me an 11 pm curfew even though I was in my 20s and never gave me a key. She not picked every little thing I did even though I tried so hard to be a good guest because I thought maybe thatâ€™s why She didnâ€™t like me. Whenever I am allowed to come here I have to bring my own food and own blanket. When I told my mom I was in such a bad mental space that I thought I was going to kill myself and didnâ€™t feel safe to be alone she said I couldnâ€™t come over.,1
"Without my boyfriend who I thought was my best friend, my two female friends who used to always have my back becoming distant, and now not knowing who or what to trust seeing as Nex and I still work in the same industry my PTSD is just skyrocketing off the charts. With no roots put back down yet (which Iâ€™m working on the living sit) and no one close to turn to emotionally, how the fuck do I go on? When is enough enough? When is it too much? I know giving up is not an option but it is all so overwhelming...",1
"Those are all the ones I can coherently explain. I've also felt extremely lonely and I've been craving touch more than I did before I was with him. Watching movies, playing games, hanging out with friends etc all distract me for a while but when I stop all the bad feelings just come at once. Not only sadness/loneliness, but I also feel hate and rage. Does anyone have any way to help me move on?",1

"I want her to tell me that she loves me, that she would only want to be with me. I just want her, and I'm even willing to give her another chance even though I know I shouldn't.

TL;DR : My wife cheated on me and I don't know how to get over her",1
"We're running out of things like dog food,toilet paper, feminine products and whatnot. Workers comp didn't send me my check this month, so I'm not able to afford the things we need and that is why I'm asking assistance. If anyone could help me with a small loan of $50 , we'd greatly appreciate it. I'm not sure when I could pay you back fully, but I could pay something back each month if that's okay. Thank you for your time!",1
"I am already accountable to my family, boyfriend, pets, co workers, etc and now I have to be accountable to these ppl I couldnâ€™t give two shits about and they are counting on me and I hate the pressure so much.

"This is something I'm working on figuring out for myself). Option 2: We each move after we each get a job in City A. Drawbacks: (1) one of us will be left at our current job for a while with our boss and coworkers knowing the other is likely to leave soon after. I'm not sure if this is an inadvisable situation. (2) BF will likely find a job first, as he has a few more years experience than me plus some management experience.",1
"When it's abuse in the workplace, it seems like everyone just says, ""Oh, get over it, and don't be a baby. There's nothing wrong with you."" I actually had one women tell me that my husband's behavior was 'completely normal' and that 'everyone acts like that' (I was floored. I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?). They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.",1
"I am afraid that she will sell the house because of this and I'm not sure what the future holds for my family. Because I made some very bad decisions in the past, my credit is horrible. I have tried to get a loan and it's just not happening. I have no car (no money to get a car, let alone make payments) and payday loans are not offered in AZ. Every online loan option, although bad, seems like a better fate than losing my home of 12 years.",1
"I check on my mom several times a day and I KNOW it has to be annoying. I am trying to find the right medication but none seem to work for me, I go to therapy, and I talk about it â€” but I am so sick of feeling this way. I know it is temporary and that I wonâ€™t be this way forever, but right now, it sucks. I canâ€™t sleep because I worry so much, itâ€™s hard to focus at work because I worry so much, itâ€™s hard to be social because I worry so much. Thanks for listening.",1
Does anyone else experience parts of their PTSD this way? &#x200B; Is this truly avoidance or is this dissociation? I tried to do some digging and pin down what I am experiencing so I can communicate with my husband more effectively but it isn't something that seems to fit nicely into a box and so it has been confusing. Thank you.,1
"All of these things were a slow burn, many of these things overlapped one another. I pushed through and finished my PhD, but now I'm worn, and after looking into it, I've realized that the psychological symptoms of stress I display are closely aligned with racism-specific PTSD. I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD. I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school. Where/how do I start?",1

I'm in college now and got high last night and felt pretty sad. I'm a wreck. I thought I've overcome this all but I'm just feeling alone again.

I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.  I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone. That's what I need the most is some sort of real connection with another human being.",1
"Only 7 years ago at the age of 9 I think I peaked in life. I was possibly the most fun kid in class and had no problem socializing with others. Used to be so happy then.

"Suddenly she snaps and goes ""I fucking hate my brother, he is the biggest piece of shit ever, I couldn't care less about him"" and just started going off. Now, I know her brother can be pretty psychotic and from what shes told me he clearly has anger issues and the rest of her family keeps ignoring it, sometimes even enabling it. So 2 minutes into her exploding, she starts crying because apparently her brother told their dad something and the dad called her and said he doesn't trust her anymore or whatever. She was very upset about the dad thing because she's very close with her dad and she's her dads favorite child (he told me that himself when I spoke with him). I didn't want to pry too much because I felt like it isn't exactly my business of their internal family issues, but my girlfriend screenshot the text messages her brother sent her and I just could not comprehend how a human being, especially a sibling, can say that to someone.",1
"We had an argument, then he started trying to break my phone by bending it. I intervened and begged him not to and he stopped short of breaking it. I was a domestic violence victim before in a previous relationship and I buried those memories, but this incident made me remember some of those memories and I feel traumatized and scared to be experiencing the same things again. I feel scared and I don't know if this would escalate into something worse. We don't have kids, and we've been married for a couple months.",1

Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health.

I want him to die because then we'll be truly safe. But I don't want him to suffer. There have been times when I did. And I denied that there was ever any love because that was easier than accepting that a man who once loved his family decided he hated them so much he wanted to kill them. I've still got half my life to lead.,1
This is all 1 days worth of stuff and itâ€™s not even everything but this has been going on for months. My mum says she doesnâ€™t know what to do with me that Iâ€™ve always been mildly anxious but itâ€™s just completely spiralled out of control since Christmas time. Also I canâ€™t sleep Iâ€™m getting 5 hours ish a night and I used to get 8 hours everyday. I donâ€™t know what to do whether Iâ€™m justified going to a doctor or Iâ€™m just being stupid and making people with real anxiety and other mental illness look bad I feel like Iâ€™m being stupid and I hate my personality. Edit:sorry I havenâ€™t posted on here before so Iâ€™m a bit worried Iâ€™ve come to the wrong sub or written it wrong.,1
"Between losing my job, my unborn baby and my husband losing his job I am overwhelmed and pretty much numb. Bills are piling up fast and I don't know what to do anymore. I make vinyl decals but just started out so I am not making much at the moment. My husband just did paperwork for a new job today and I am waiting to hear back on a job I interviewed for. Unfourtunatley it won't be soon enough because the finance company for my car called and said I need to pay $439 by tomorrow, another $439 by the end of the month.",1
"Sometimes my voice catches for a minute and I flush dark red. I feel like my heart is in my throat, like it's closed up a bit. Bump. Bump. Bump.",1
"I feel like I've failed. I keep having this fear that I've made it all up. Everything. That I made up the rape, and made up the traumatizing feelings, made up the emotions. I'm afraid that I just have a very sick, sick dramatic mind that is just making up terrible shit to try and destroy me or something?",1
"So I let myself get sucked in and... The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions. I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room. This guy told me I was possessed by an evil spirit. I remember thinking, he felt ""off"".",1
"Hello, As is probably always the case, I have no idea how to start this post. My girlfriend of the past year asked me to sit and talk to her yesterday where she opened up and told me how the relationship had run its course and how there was no chance it could be saved. I have known something wasn't quite right for a while and should have made efforts to make changes long before now. We are still going to remain friends as best we can until the tenancy on our flat runs out.",1
"Unfortunately with the way things have worked out this month, I am left with little cash until my SSDI is deposited a week from Friday. And normally Iâ€™d say Iâ€™d just wait until then to take my dog, Kane, to the vet, but he has developed a little bit of a cough, and he doesnâ€™t seem as active as he normally is (<2yo chocolate lab, so he should be pretty active). I called the vet and they suspect it could be heartworms, so while I have the $50 for the office visit, I donâ€™t have the $45 for the test. Any help towards this would be greatly appreciated. I can pay back, but as sad as it sounds, I might have to make it in a couple payments as Iâ€™m on a fixed income.",1
"He has made me eat until I literally threw up, then forced me to eat my vomit. He plays mental games that are pure torture. He knows how to break me down mentally until I just become ruined for a period of time. He will point guns at me. He made me play Russian Roulette (turns out the gun wasn't loaded but he used a hand trick to make it appear loaded.",1
"I posted in this subreddit about 6 years ago and find myself here again. I am just venting, and hoping someone can normalize me... but I know itâ€™s probably 1 in a million posts. The past several months have been horrific. I deal with death on a daily basis at my job, and worked the 1 October shooting in Las Vegas. Then, on 10/15, my mother was rushed to the hospital for a seizure.",1
"But then I get angry so quickly and I feel terrible because I snapped at someone who didnâ€™t deserve it and I just donâ€™t understand where it comes from. Or Iâ€™ll suddenly start thinking about what happened to me and Iâ€™ll get really really depressed, again out of nowhere. One minute Iâ€™m functioning okay and the next I seem like someone else.   I donâ€™t know if this is a symptom of my PTSD or if thereâ€™s something else mentally wrong with me thatâ€™s being piled on top of the PTSD. I was just recently diagnosed so I guess Iâ€™m still trying to figure out whatâ€™s the PTSD and whatâ€™s just me losing my mind.",1
"So im m15 im still in school ive been through abuse when i was a kid it scarred my head i live with my mum now but i usually roam in woods playing guitar, i got diagnosed when i was 14 shit sucks gives me flashbacks whenever i close my eyes, my mind scans every goddamn thing in the area every fucking thing!, i just dont know how to explain its so complicated my brain acts weird at times i just need to know wtf is happening with me! ive only got a gf and noone else. any help is appropriated. thanks in advance",1
"Due to leaving my hairbrush at home during Spring Break, I haven't been able to brush my hair in months. I am also almost out of deodorant, toothpaste, and mouth rinse. My lease for my apartment will be running out on the 31st, meaning I'll be going back home to Houston (where I'll get a different job that actually calls me into work and doesn't leave me with only 8 cents in my account. I wish I was kidding). I'll need to clean the apartment for inspection, so I also need some cleaning supplies.",1
"He also talked very condescendingly to me and the other female servers, as well as being a total arse in general. I wanted to say something SO badly, but by the time I worked up the courage, he took her arm and led her to their car. Also, I didn't want to make things worse for her by sticking up for her in public. I wrote down their license plate number and car model, but I did not get the chance to see the name on the card he paid with. I really want to reach out to this woman.",1
But I could feel construction workers staring at me. I know I might be paranoid but I donâ€™t want to take chances anymore Iâ€™m scared. I already paid for a year at the gym (about 6 months ago.) Do you think I should talk to someone about getting at least a partial refund for the 6 months? I donâ€™t want to bring my situation up to them and have them say sorry but not our problem.,1
The violence was still happening. The mind games were also still happening so I felt like it was my fault. That I had done something wrong to â€œdeserveâ€ it. I supported both him and myself in this new state while he was in school. I ended up losing my job for reasons out of my control and had a really difficult time finding a new job.,1
"We were able to get everything out quickly but.. this isnt a simple fix anymore. We have a roofer coming out on the 4th for an estimate, but unless its about 400 which I doubt it will be, I have no idea how to pay for this. This year has gotten worse and worse each month. We just blew everything we have to get out water pump fixed so we'd have water again (10.5k) plus our AC broke (luckily only $400) and then our car battery died (120..) ive maxed out every card I have, can barely make the min payments cause stuff keeps piling so my credit has been shot and I just...

"I have had a rough few months. A few years ago I was diagnosed with ptsd after being the victim of a violent robbery. It caused a few panic attacks followed by a day or two of ultra high anxiety, but would always subside. The last 2.5 months in this order I have dealt with the following things: 1.",1
"I can't stay in my hometown either, where we are both abused and there are no job prospects. We have to go where there is work. He lives in a bigger city where there are definitely jobs. I know I should ask him about her first, but like I said, I'm afraid he'll say no and we'll be stuck here indefinitely. Any advice?",1
"My mom never threw books at me, but the impact of something along with the name-calling was enough. I ran to my room and I honestly don't remember what I did. I remember my attack going on for hours, but everything else is blurry. Now my grandma's ""sorry"". She was ""stressed out"" so she did that.",1
"3: This is the big one. I'm currently unemployed, as I was in school (paid for by the Department of Rehabilitation), so I cannot meet ANY income requirement.

"Short - I live in Christchurch, New Zealand and my friend is currently getting beaten by her husband, but has 3 dogs and will not leave without taking them with her as she fears what he might do to them. Long - She is currently living in a diffrent room to him but is getting beaten most nights, she has not signed a tenancy aggrement and the house she is renting is owned by her husbands best friend. She has pictures of the bruising and blood aswell as screenshots of the messages he is sending her. She has been in contact with womans refuge, unfortunatly there is not alot they can do because she does not want to leave. Also one of the dogs is old and usually sleeps inside.",1
"Since then, I've been having major anxiety about my voice and have refused to speak to anyone because I am afraid that they will think I am a lying robot. If I sound this way when I'm feeling energetic and confident, how must I sound the rest of the time??? However, I know that I am going to have to speak again eventually because not only do I have a job interview AND a party on Tuesday BUT I also have to do most of the speaking for my boyfriend as he is not confident at all in his English. Have any of you ever been told you sound like a robot? How did you overcome it or how did you stop feeling anxious about this?",1
So I have been a bunch of strange symptoms over the last 3 weeks which have caused me to freak out thinking that I have MS. The symptoms are 1. A sense of something crawling over my skin. This is very random and never never localized and jumps from one leg to another and to my arms i think i got it even in my lower back and neck (I think),1

"I am really worried about my future as it feels my anxiety always has me quitting jobs or having issues while I was in school. I can't even travel and work out of state as last time I tried I missed my interview and was nearly hospitalized with severe anxiety (travel is a trigger for me).

"I can't stay standing, or even sitting for extended periods of time without severe consequences to my neck, and my head. And more recently have been experiencing heart trouble. I'm getting some doctors to look at me but they haven't found anything yet. I've literally been going with no money or insurance and bills are piling up. Since I cannot commit to any continuous work, I'm finding it impossible to make money.",1
"I am obviously devastated. I feel disappointed, angry, sad and rejected. I'm constantly asking myself why she no longer wants to live with me. She says she wants to have her own space to go to when she wants to be at ease, ""not that she doesn't feel at ease with me, it's just different"". I tried to make her see that we're supposed to make a new home for ourselves where we will both feel at ease, but to no avail.",1
"I need help talking about this: you can still be a good person even if you mess up sometimes. As long as you try, it'll be ok. I'm so afraid of people leaving me because I made them sad, I was mean, or I annoy them, anything, and they'll hold it against me even if I try to improve and make concentrated efforts to change. It's crippling. It's a catastrophic thought.",1

"So again, here I am, with no idea what to do. I don't have any particular skills, besides almost never getting fatigued, the ability to walk for hours on end without getting tired, lifting some pretty heavy objects despite my skinny figure, and a few other things. I know some Korean, and am studying Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish (self taught). The only things of value that I have anymore are my phone and laptop that I've had since I ran away, and I mainly use the wifi at work to access the internet. My only source of sleep is a 30-60 minute nap I manage to sneak in inside the changing stalls at the gym I shower at, unless a coworker is nice enough to let me stay with them for a few nights.",1
"Can you relate? TL;DR: I did something stupid at work. A coworker called me out for it, and rightfully so. I apologized, she accepted, and all is now good. *But I can't stop thinking about it, dwelling on it.",1
"My mom finally had a response, basically my brother works very hard (and he does, he does manual work, which I know is very hard) but nothing regarding me. I don't know what to do- maybe I am overreacting but I don't know.  P.s. my brother stays out of everything, he is kind and asks me questions but doesn't play games with my sister and is usually out of the room doing something.   **tl;dr**:I feel like no matter what I do - my family is disappointed at me and if I ask to not be fun of it just gets worse.",1
"The only woman who ever treated me with respect, my nan, died a few months ago. This household is screwing with all of us. There's nothing we can do, because she refuses to seek help, so this will never change. I want to move out, but I have nowhere to go, no job, and no money. The best I can do is wait it out until someone dies, I suppose.",1
"My friend is coming to get me in the grocery store parking lot where I wound up after. It is, legally, without a doubt my fault, although actually not because the cops cut the guy in front of me off to let some school busses go past without traffic or whatever, the roads were slick, and I couldnâ€™t stop in time, but Iâ€™m still freaking out in my head. Ugh. Mentally just not alright right now. I should not have gone out today.",1
"But one night, I somehow picked up on a pattern or loop in the cricket sounds, and I haven't been able to listen to it since. My brother had the same model in the room next to mine, and I ended up getting him a new one for his birthday because even puddles through the wall, every single loop felt like an ice pick to my forehead. It's like my brain knows what sound is coming and the auditory auto-correct is mentally painful and dread inducing. Any advice/suggestions would be helpful-- can't seem to get the right combination of experiences/symptoms from misophonia, sensory processing, etc. Thanks!",1
"I'm a freelancer, which means pay isn't always steady. I also have frequent painful and difficult digestive issues as well as migraines that lay me out several times a month. I work hard, I make an effort to save where I can, but some months bills and such wipe me out. I'm just coming through a bout of sick and feeling up to eating again, but thanks to pay waits and bills, I'm broke and down to a bit of brown rice and gelatin in the house. I made a post this morning on r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza and a mod pointed me here for some slightly more substantial help.",1
"I clean the living room everyday. I take care of the kids, dinner, homework, put to bed, wash all the bottle stuff at night. I try to make our bed everyday, but have been slacking on that lately. I clean our room (although not nearly as often as I should), I take out garbage, I wash the counters and oven. I ask him to do the kitchen, which sometimes takes days for him to get to.",1
"Since then I have heard from him once, in the form of a drunken voicemail pleading with me to forgive him and swearing that he doesn't remember anything. I may be able to believe that if I didn't know he was a manipulative pathological liar. The worst thing about this to me is that he has two kids, a little girl and a little boy who I absolutely adore. I haven't been able to see them in five years (I'm nineteen now). If anyone is reading this, and you're wondering why I didn't call the police, I did.",1
"It's always been something I have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. I think it stems down to the fact I had a tooth removed when I was only 5. Doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me I had to have it removed till the actual day. She just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. Obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that I had to wait 3 hours when I got there.",1
"The past few months especially have been hard on me. I think about her often, not even necessarily in a sexual manner, but I miss her. Even more so, the fantasies have started up again. I have vivid, detailed dreams about her sexually, and they upset me throughout the day, and I don't know what to think. Any advice?",1
"Hi, My partner is a Dv survivor after 15 years, he eroded everything about her and mentally abused her mostly throughout with sexual elements towards the last few years Shes lovely, the most caring girl in the world and so beautiful But its also not easy, she likes a few drinks at weekends and the drink brings out a different girl or maybe its the true girl im not sure, this girl has vivid flashbacks and they are pretty harsh Shes in therapy too and thats tough going as well its popping the cork on all the anger she has bottled up over 15 years",1
"I come from an Asian family where kids are not expected to move out, its the opposite where kids are supposed to live at home and take care of the parents when they become adults, however living in America has made me hate this mindset because I am never able to be an individual. My dad is extremely controlling and a downright bully, he verbally abuses me and my siblings about anything possible just for the sake of abusing us. He always demands we listen to him and do things his way and if we don't we are ""disobedient"" and ""bad children"". He even abuses my mom verbally and she knows it but deals with because its how she was raised, even random strangers like waiters and cashiers at stores are bullied, he'll complain about lines being long and blame cashiers for being ""slow"" ect. OVERALL THIS MAD IS EXTREMELY NEGATIVE and if you try to talk back or explain to him to be a little bit nicer he gets defensive and goes on a tantrum how hes our dad and we have no right to talk to him like that.",1
"I'm scared, and I've been on edge for the past few days. He has two 4th degree felony charges and I'm so worried that lack of evidence will push the judge to reconsider his charges. My ex is claiming self-defense, even though I wasn't attacking him. I'm way too small of a person, it doesn't even make sense. He towers over me, how does he expect people to believe him?",1
"But now i want that to change. My need for paxil is in direct relations to panic attacks or aggression attacks as i refer to them sometimes. I tend to get agitated easily or snap at people if I feel panicky or if I am embarrassed or put in situations I do not like I get agitated to the point of being a dick and yelling a lot. Which my family ends up being on the wrong side of my temper tantrums, my panick attacks turn into agitation and defensiveness. Ha anyone else switched from paxil successfully or anyone with a similar situation using something different?",1
"No wonder I get scolded for bad grades, called a lazy, worthless piece of fuck because I am too lazy or too stupid to care about exams and my future, but in reality, I deeply care too much as if I feel like the whole fucking world of 7 billion people, and millions or billions of other organisms are on my shoulders ... and all I can do is to shut down entirely. I shut down by brain, my thoughts, my emotions, everything because I cannot take all the anxiety. All the pressure. All the fear and terror. Sometimes I feel as depressed as if I am a lonely guy in a post-apocalyptic setting where everyone is either dead or absent or gone.",1
"It's true that I can probably be annoying (messy, absent-minded so I forget/lose things a lot, I'm also always making (possibly annoying) jokes about everything, and afraid that comes off as attention-seeking or something), but I don't really have any evidence that I was bothering anyone. In fact, it seemed like we were all having a great time. But I'm having a hard time shaking my worry that I acted like an idiot or something. I felt the same way after going to my favorite cousin's wedding last year, who I also hadn't seen in a couple years. **tl;dr**: does anyone else feel reasonably comfortable in social situations as they occur, but then torture yourself over them after they have come to pass?",1
"I'm going crazy. Now I'm jobless because my attempts to please/help her only screwed myself over and now I'm jobless and my mental health issues are coming out. Getting jobs is really hard for me due to some PTSD from my parents, but I'm trying my best to push through it and get a job ASAP. I'm dropping out of school (again) so I can work on my financials, but in the meantime, I NEED OUT!!!!!!! !",1
"TL;DR: I wish to ask out my longtime friend this Valentines, but I am afraid of my past coming back and ruining my renewed trust with both her and my friends that Iâ€™ve worked years to repair. Note, what I am not scared of is rejection, I am scared of being feared or hated once again. How I most easily do away with the stigma revolving around my past  so that I can be judged by who I am now instead of who I was in the past? Thatâ€™s what is keeping me up at night. I look forward to what the community has to say.",1
"Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I canâ€™t take this anymore. I was doing so much fucking better lately, and just like a snap of a finger, I am disassociating harder then I ever have before. It comes out of nowhere, when Iâ€™m having an other wise good day. No anxiety or depression but out of nowhere I get extremely disassociated.",1
"I donâ€™t know how to make him leave because he says if I do that he will go and dispute all the charges I ever made on his debit card and say it was fraud and he will have me prosecuted. In the past when we were together I stupidly sent him private photos of myself and he threatens to send them to my church, my parents, and my bosses. He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now heâ€™s saying Iâ€™m lying). I feel like he literally dictates my life. He breaks things in my apartment.",1
"I loved this person dearly with all my heart, and it was an extremly tragic and sudden death. I want to go to my doctor but im already in counceling. Ive only gone once and my next visit is on wednesday. Should I tell my greif councellor? Thanks for reading.",1
"The contract with Apex is over and they screwed me hard. I don't have another job lined up despite having never stopped looking, and I was counting on my income taxes to pay back all the people who I borrowed money from and buy me some time to get a proper job and fix all of this. Now I have no idea what I'm going to do. Everything is falling apart is even bigger chunks than before. All of the bills are due again and rent is coming up.",1
"I have a fear of fainting so I was like â€œwhat if I fainted from so much fear during this testâ€ and next thing you know, worst panic attack of my life during the quiz and I failed it.

"I have this feeling of dread about school right before I go to bed and I wake up with an upset stomach which lasts all day and nakes me feel like I'll throw up. This causes me to lose appetite and not wanting to drink water for fear of throwing up. I'm not sure where else to go with this, but I need help. If any of you have this, can you tell me how you deal with it? I'm tired of having this every day and feeling like I'll throw up.",1
"My stress tolerance was already at a zero and I was contemplating suicide a lot, i didnâ€™t want to see where that would lead me and I didnâ€™t want to do that to my brothers. I was incredibly lucky and got referred to a good psychologist that I like. Heâ€™s helping me through the problems of getting rehabilitation welfare, which is a hassle because I constantly have to talk to new counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists which triggers breakdowns. I hate talking about myself to strangers, Iâ€™m not ashamed at all, I just hate having to share how I truly feel with strangers. It makes it so real.",1
"I don't know if it was the campground, or if the probably former friend wanted some revenge. All of the hotels are way out of our price range in our area. We can stay a couple of nights, and our reservation at the campground ends this weekend. I will be asking for a refund of the remaining nights. I'm terrified that our kids will be taken from us for being homeless for less than 6 weeks.",1
"I close the door and put my back against it. He's slamming into the door, trying to break into it, yelling that I'm crazy and I'm making everything up. I'm terrified and sobbing, yelling for help and for him to leave me alone. At this point I'm begging him to let me get my phone to call my dad to come get me. He finally tells me that I can, and that he can't wait for me to be gone.",1
Apparently it has been going on since the day they moved in together. I don't know what to tell her thought. Since her husband is a good friend of me and my husband it's kinda weird for me to say 'leave him' or 'get out' I don't want to influence any decision she makes. What should I tell her? Tl;dr: friends husband is aggresive and I don't know what to tell her,1
"One second Iâ€™m thinking, things are just fine. The next Iâ€™m thinking, Iâ€™m awful for prolonging this, just do it. Itâ€™s exhausting. I know I need a bit of a break for some me time at the very least, but beyond that I canâ€™t tell whatâ€™s real and what anxiety. What do I do?",1
"Oh Jesus Christ. I blacked out in front of my family- my family with a history of alcoholism (I'm an alcoholic too), my family that I promised I wouldn't get drunk in front of....I don't know what I said but they are PISSED.

"Does anyone have any similar experience and were you able to become functioning friends with your ex or was it best to cut all ties, even if it meant losing friends? TL;DR Broke up with my girlfriend of ten years because she fell in love with a complete stranger from overseas.

Should I cut her out of my life and lose friends or make more of an effort to be friendly/peaceful towards her?",1
"Now I'm terrified of starting this new job because even if it's better than my old one, I'm scared I'll lose all the progress I've made. When I'm overwhelmed I tend to just sleep and everything else falls to the wayside. I feel like I can't stay with part time work because all my friends and family expect me to get back to full time work ASAP, and feel like I'm not moving forward in my career otherwise. Everyone keeps telling me to just give it a chance, it'll all work out, but I'm not sure what to do/think. Advice on what to do about work and how to calm down enough to sleep tonight and how best to manage everything going forward?",1
"Why is this the hardest month? Is it that the nerves have cleared, minute by minute anxiety calmed, hopelessness resolved, and now I have to sit a grieve a person I made up in my head? The person I convinced myself he was is so much more attractive than the reality of what he was. He is 27, Iâ€™m 25, and now heâ€™s targeting 21 year olds. I am broken but I am piecing myself together.",1
"Hello. As you can tell by the title, I'm concerned about this little girl across the street. She's able to walk and talk, but I don't think she's even 5 yet. From what I've witnessed the four years I've lived in this house, the home she lives in is not at all suitable for her as a developing child. Her parents are constantly screaming at each other in the street, and the girl is bawling, as her mom commands her to get into her car so she can take her wherever.",1
"We've been getting along very well, and our previous repeated complaints on both sides of ceased because of this. But as time has gone on my feelings have changed in regards to me thinking I can accept this and work through it with her. I know I love her, and I don't really know how to explain my emotions here, but I no longer feel like ""her husband"", and I don't feel like she's ""my wife"", it's more like we're partners or room mates or something. I feel a vital part of our marriage (loyalty, and trust) is gone and it can't come back. In the end, I can't shake the thoughts of leaving and restarting my life.",1
I only realized this was a stupid idea in my freshman year of college when I started having flashbacks. I tried once more to do therapy and almost failed out of school. Again I buried it all to be dealt with at a more convenient time. I have now been working in a job that don't mind for the last year and 3 months. I found that November and December were a struggle and because of that I planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,1
"A few days before Valentineâ€™s Day, someone sent me screenshots of him talking to a girl on FaceTime or Instagram saying â€œyouâ€™re so cuteâ€ and flirting with her. I decided not to say anything- the girl lived in another state and I didnâ€™t want to bring it up. I figured she was a fried from when he had hitchhiked across the country when he was in college. I waited till Valentineâ€™s Day, and called him up- he told me â€œI donâ€™t think we should live together, and I just signed a 9 month lease at my apartment.â€ I was livid. He brought me 2 dozen roses and I smashed them in front of him in a parking lot.",1
"My boyfriend constantly states that we are no longer in a relationship and I need to be constantly working towards showing him that he will want to be with me again. I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning in the house. I try my best to make sure his needs are met, even if it means that my needs fall short almost always. It seems like any ""everyday"" argument we have about something always turns into me being a piece of shit because of what I did to him. He tells me that I made him this way and I need to deal with it until he moves past it, which I understand and agree with.",1
My anxiety and ocd have been terrible the last few weeks. I've recently started drinking again (stupid I know) and I'm feeling like I need to use it as a crutch again. I am prescribed valium and an anti depressant but I find that the simple act of just having a drink helps more. My main issue is my health anxiety. I have been having the worst sinus and headache flare ups.,1
"I self harm sometimes too. Iâ€™ve also lately begun to have constant, daily, and explicit nightmares about tarantulas, roaches, and beetles crawling over me while Iâ€™m paralyzed. I donâ€™t know itâ€™s thatâ€™s relevant or anything, but it may be good to add anyways. Iâ€™m asking bc I donâ€™t want the therapist to yell at me or call me a liar like the last few did, so Iâ€™m low key nervous and I donâ€™t want to get in any more trouble with my school. Any thoughts or criticisms are welcome.",1
"lost best friend of 12 years  also i ""think"" i have some type of skin things weather it's mites or fleas or scabies or something idk i'm guessing scabbies and i've tried the remedy for it multiple times but it didn't cure it just kinda lessened the symptoms so w/e it is i have or if it's all in my head i have no idea also been getting alot of headaches but yeah and i'm completely confused and i have no idea what to do or anything i've been researching and trying to find stuff but google isn't that good apparently, i've found out about couchsurfers, dumpster divers, and stuff i just i don't know what to do i really just wish i could start over, or find some kinda self help group or facility. Some where that could help me out with life skills and with my confusion, depression etc again im just really confused and not sure what to do.",1
"Itâ€™s almost a 50/50 mindset, because on one hand she wouldnâ€™t ever wish to be thought of or treated in a horrid way, I have corrected it best I can, and she is the kind of person to forgive and forget. Itâ€™s hard. Itâ€™s real hard to decide what to do. So thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here today people of Reddit. I realize this isnâ€™t the most pressing, serious, or dramatic post on here, but I stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance, some past experience, wisdom, or advice on what I can do or try so that the â€œhere and nowâ€ are in question, and not â€œthen and thereâ€, so that my confession can go along without regret.",1
"My tourist visa ends November. Part of me wants to wait shit out until my green card gets here and then leave him. The other part of me wants to walk to my nearest lawyer so that I can hand him divorce papers, and demand money to send me and my dog back home. He said If I am wanting to go home, I should pay him back from my credit card the $2000 for immigration paperwork and $600 lump sum CrossFit membership he paid for me. What to do...",1
"I don't know what to do anymore. She doesn't want help, but I am feeling hopeless with her, and I'm afraid it's going to take a toll on our relationship. I have my own mental health issues that I am actively dealing with and I just wish she could see that her issues are affecting people other than herself.   ---   **tl;dr**: My mother has unaddressed mental health issues, how do I get her to take it seriously and seek professional help?",1
I don't know... I don't know what to do. I just want out of here. It's too hard. With this house and school work.,1
"It is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that. I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no. I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions. I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards. But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.",1
"How about that? No this isn't just some edgy teen, oh I hate my dad, I have every reason to hate him, for what he has done, and continues to purposely do to me and my family. For nearly killing me, for scarring us all to the point I can't even meet a nice person, or have any friends, and not wonder whether they do or don't treat their family like a lump of sh**. Nobody needs, nor should they ever have to live the life I have been forced to live. Nobody should have to call the police because they don't feel safe within their own home.",1
In the last year I have developed some health problems. I started having seizures and because of them I had to miss work. Because of that I got fired. I was doing okay still while looking for another job by donating plasma. But my car got repossessed a few days ago and I havenâ€™t been able to get there to donate.,1
"I could stay up here alone, but he says heâ€™ll be where ever we are. I feel trapped and I think itâ€™s making me like Iâ€™m acting like a child these days. At least from my perspective. He drained my accounts and Iâ€™m financially dependent because I fear not paying bills and I have to feed my daughter and myself. In laws say they can help us...but theyâ€™re still his parents.",1
"It wasn't an issue, nobody needed to know, now I don't even know *what* people apparently ""know"" and are arguing about. Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal. Maybe I'm just pretending I don't care? Maybe none of this even happened? I just don't know anymore.",1
"My boyfriend didn't care. I started to get psychotic at 17. I  was so scared, paranoid, had delusions and hallucinations. And no-one to help me. All this hell lasted until I was 22.",1
"I of course understand her wanting me to be safe, but I have an IUD and use condoms 100% of the time, which she knows because she pries about my sex life. She knows I'm sexually active and I don't have a boyfriend and is really judgmental about me having casual sex. I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life. When I was younger, she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done, and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt. Whenever we argue she makes it a time to critique my entire personality and not just my behavior in that argument or even within my relationship with her.",1
"Iâ€™m also quite intellectual, I can speak 2 languages other than my native language, English and Japanese. But I only want my boyfriend, he has a shy personality but heâ€™s very knowledgeable, heâ€™s like a walking Wikipedia and I love him so much. He makes me feel calm just laughing at our inside jokes, receiving a cute text from him, and ever since being in a relationship with him Iâ€™ve grown to be happy with the smallest things in life. But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past, or heâ€˜s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts, also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem. All of this really took a toll of our relationship, to the point that we hardly called anymore or had any communication.",1
"Update - Thanks all, I have calmed down a bit now. Will sleep on it and hopefully tackle with a clearer head tomorrow. --- **tl;dr**: Found out from stranger on Facebook my partner is most likely going to leave me, feel betrayed she posted it on a public forum like Facebook. Right now feeling useless, am introverted and quiet by nature so I donâ€™t have much of a support network.",1
"Its hard knowing that everyone around you doesn't have these issues, It's hard that it takes an extreme amount of work just to make a normal day in life go by smoothly(which it almost never does) At first I felt like I had a grasps on this whole PTSD thing because it made sense when I first got diagnosed but the longer it's been the harder this is to deal with. Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off? this is the answer I give when people ask me what's wrong, because there's always more than one thing going on at the same time. I find myself drinking more than i'd like to admit,I never drank before this, anything to take the edge off. I feel like I'm having to teach myself everything all over again, I don't even know how to formulate that into words.",1
"As you can tell, this is quite a bit more than my ""income"" of 250... Today, I got my car tax bill; 190 euro. We do have a wellfare/social security thingie office, but they have turned me down, because their limit IS 250 (rent excluded, but they seriously claim that my brother SHOULD house and feed me...so I get nothing) Without the car, I can't GET to the little work I get - at this point, I can't buy fucking toilet paper - my brother loses about 300 euro per month supporting me (heating, food, hygiene) I don't even know what to do anymore.",1
"I am worried that I may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to a few notable symptoms/issues that I experience. (I also have one notable traumatic experience involving an accident my father was in, he got hit by a bus when I was seventeen and almost died, which I do have nightmares and flashbacks of, but that is a different story.) Does anyone have any idea if this is possible to have the disorder due to a multitude of experiences? Thank you for any advice, help, or information in advance. It is greatly appreciated.",1
"Something like that happened again. He was angry with me and wanted me to go to another room so he didn't have to look at me but I wanted to stay (not getting involved in any conflict or anything, just doing my studying and not interacting) so he took me out of the room by force, not hard again, but I got hysterical nonetheless. After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going. In about an hour he came to me and it looked like his anger was unresolved as he was provoking me. I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on.",1
"It helps with the physical symptoms, such as palpatations and elevated heart rate. However I still have attacks that force me to lay down alone for 30 minutes or more, sometimes hours. I have random pains all the time, my arm, leg, chest, stomach, headaches, etc. Constant health anxiety too, I get one mild headache and think I have meningitis or a brain tumor, etc. Well I had a checkup with him today and asked him about medicine I could use PRN.",1
"Some days I can't hear music from that time period, watch a show that's remotely emotional, or just sit without tearing up. I've never been to see a shrink, although I know I should of, due to past experiences and money issues. I was diagnosed with PTSD and told I should talk to someone. I don't know where to go usually. Especially on nights like these where I can't be quiet without thinking about that night or breaking down in tears.",1
"I'm a 24 yr old female and I've never had a person I could call a friend in my life. There was a 2 and a half year period where I barely left the apartment. My first job was when I was 23. Its a warehouse job and it will have been a year since I started working there in a couple of weeks. Even though I've been there for that long I havent formed any relationship with anyone there because i always avoid getting too familiar with anyone, that's my default way of being and I hate it.",1
"Recently my anxiety has gotten really bad, possibly the worse it has ever been and Iâ€™ve been experiencing panic attacks, but I still canâ€™t justify taking my medication because I feel like I deserve to suffer. I also struggle with the feeling like Iâ€™m making all this up and none of my problems exist which I know rationally cannot be true when Iâ€™ve struggled with this for most my life, however I still canâ€™t shift it. I donâ€™t know if this is part of my anxiety making me feel like this or whether it is another thing Iâ€™ve made myself believe. I guess Iâ€™m just looking for some advice and reassurance. Iâ€™m just really tired of feeling this way and constantly being in turmoil with my mind.",1
"When we returned a year ago, we had some very rough boundary issues (trying to forward face in their car, feeding baby junk, criticizing our parenting choices, etc.) with them. MIL has ""anxiety and depression"" and cannot address the issues she causes so FIL addresses them for her. It's the worst case of coddling I've ever seen. She does not see a mental health professional (because narcissist) and blames everyone else for any wrong she may do, which of course she does no wrong.",1
"It made me feel so... small. After I left, I felt angry, really fucking angry. I don't want to call the office and make a fuss, I want it behind me. I'm just angry that someone could really think that way. I'm angry.",1
"I'm feel when I read about sth or learnt sth and I talk loud about that I feel I'm fake. I have this feeling that I try to impress someone or my knowledge is shallow and in fact I don't understand this or that well so actually I pretend and I always waiting for someone to laugh at me or correct me. In fact I feel like a shallow person with lack of knowledge \(even basic\) and I myself against me by judging I'm fake, it's not importan what I know or think and generally it's funny when I'm serious because I'm so kiddo what could I know what real life is and how can I know anything. because of that experience most of the time I am full of anxiety and barely leave my house. I was even too anxious to post online.",1
"I had crippling anxiety and depression during my college years and finally managed to graduate within the allotted semesters after getting diagnosed and learning to cope . I'm about to go in for a set of interviews and wonder if i should be honest about why my grades dropped all of a sudden and got back to normal (fell into depression/anxiety cycle). Also, wondering if it is overall even advisable to talk about mental health issues to your boss AT ALL in a workplace. What was your personal experience? **TL;DR did you tell your boss about your mental health issues?",1
I had a panic attack and broke down crying in front of my mom. She scheduled me an appointment for therapy and I just feel like bleh. I dont care about getting better right now. My whole body is in shock from that panic attack and I just feel like death. I honestly doubt I will get better,1
"The ""me too"" movement I've found to be extremely inspirational and empowering. I am no longer ashamed of what happened to me, but I still don't feel like I'm healing. I was hoping that these flashbacks and the anxiety, fear and dread would go away over time, but they haven't. How do people cope? What do you read?",1
"Without my meds I can be kinda unstable, few months back I stopped taking them and ended up breaking my hand because of it. I have no real education except high school diploma and I wasn't smart enough to finish community college as I'm useless with math and science and that's all I needed to finish for a general studies degree. All I seem to be doing is existing and that means I'm a burden on anyone who tries to help me and right now I'm dragging my partner down. I just need help figuring out what to do so I can stop being burdensome and be useful and have a purpose again. I don't really know what to do anymore, but this is all I have left to try.",1
"I refuse to carry both of us anymore and I'm also tired of the drama between us as well. So, part of me hopes he doesn't pay the rent and that'll give me my push to really move on. Anyway, I'm ok with going to a shelter, but I worry about my laptop. I remember when I was living in a shelter when I was a kid, they didn't allow you to have certain items. I don't want to part with my laptop for them to keep it safe and it gets ""lost"".",1
"I made a mistake as a result of being shaken up. Now she has complained to my boss but has falsely amplified my one mistake into me being absolutely negligent and incompetent. I found out about this 8 hours ago, had another flashback/panic attack, and my heart is still pounding. I've convinced myself I'm going to get fired. I know I need to go back to counseling.",1
"Because I have! And it literally makes me feel 10k x crazier than I already feel as it is. She left me alone, meds unfilled, and then told all her colleagues I was trying to scam ADHD medication off of her, so now none of them want to take my case either. Backstory, Iâ€™ve been seeing this doctor for 3 years almost now and at first I let her know my commitment issues with mental health, and having people just leave me stranded or pass me to new doctors every week and it made me bail the first few times Iâ€™ve tried to get my brain right. So we have appointments every 3-6 ish months depending on medication change.",1
He loves them and treats them like gold. I love the type of father he is but I hate the way he treats me. I have no one to open up to or go to if I even tried to leave him. Iâ€™m tired of him abusing me mentally and physically me. He has cheated on me several times and each time it knocks my self esteem Lower and lower.,1
This month and last have been very touch and go. I have sold everything under the sun to keep my home but I am probably not going to make it. It's to the point I have sat and weighed the pros and cons of suicide (please don't talk about this subject.) But I've used up every single resource and realized I don't really know many people in the city I'm in. I don't have much of family any where close and none I could live with.,1
"Theyâ€™re like flashbacks and everything I hated that he did , I want this new person to do to me to the point where I break down again. What the fuck is wrong with me please. These are violent degrading fantasies and they make me feel like a really disturbed person. The thought after an orgasm literally makes me cry. Someone out there has to know what Iâ€™m talking about please.",1
"I was getting changed into a pair of shorts and was standing. When I lifted one leg to put on the shorts, I was very shaky and it was uncontrollable. Even just when I stand, my legs shake. What is going on?! I'm scared out of my mind because no one else on the internet seems to have this exact issue so I have no idea where to look.",1
"Dealing with ptsd from rape, and recently found out that someone who I thought was a friend sexually assaulted one of our friends at a party we were at. I get flashbacks of waking up whenever we were at parties together and I've seen him awake once or twice and even though the likelyhood is very low (given the background of what he did), I can't shake the feeling that he mightve done something to me. What he did to her is giving me feelings like what happened to her was actually me. My doctor suggested womens group therapy, but I wanted some opinions first. Any thoughts will help",1
I thought I did well but I was severely depressed. That weekend was my birthday weekend and he made it miserable. He said I was a brat to ever think that it was a special day. I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him. I didn't even get a gift or affection.,1
"I just couldn't cope, the abuse I already remembered was bad enough but this...this was just too much for me to deal with. 2 weeks ago I couldn't take it anymore and took a large overdose, which ended up with me being in hospital...I now have done a little damage to my heart and shall have to live with that...I should probably point out that I am under 7st and have had an eating disorder since I was 7...it was the only thing I could control...you see I had no safe place, I'd leave my abusive home and go to school...where I was the only ginger child...sure I don't need to point out how hard that was. This is going to stop quite abruptly now, for I don't really know what else to say right now.. Each and everyday is a constant struggle and I am tired of drs telling me to be strong and just get on with life...I am 26years old for 20years I have had to be strong and ""survive"" well I'm tired of surviving...that doesn't mean I want to die but I do want it all to stop, I want to <url> to be happy and trust people, to realise what love is, I mean I have an amazing partner who loves me dearly but I question him every damn day...you see he doesn't hurt me and love...well as my Dad taught me...love is to hurt and lie....but that isn't love at all is it? !",1
"I'm scared I'm going to slip the next time I get in the car or on my motorcycle and just plow into something at full speed just because it'd be so easy and it might end all the pain. But then I don't want to do that, because I have a safe car, and I wear full safety gear when I ride, so those are both maybes. I don't have a gun. I find my thoughts straying from just using one if I had one to thinking of places I could buy one from. Does Walmart sell them in California?",1
"Though I have been staying with family, their households are getting packed with other members and issues and so they have no room for me. I do not have many friends, and the ones I do cannot help whatsoever. So, I am on my own. I have a wonderful as a baker that I don't want to lose or give up. What can I do in my situation right now so that I am able to keep a roof over my head and still keep my job because I know that if I am just able to keep shelter while continuing to work this job, I will be able to provide decent housing and expenses for myself and never burden anyone with my problems ever again.",1
"But I see him during classes and it might be extremely weird. And I don't want to go to the counselling room and knock on the door, what if they're having a session? And I'm probably gonna just nervously laugh while walking in. Talking to my teachers about it is a no no. I can't go to a therapist directly due to my parents lack of understanding and ignorance of mental illnesses.",1
"I'm 20 years old and suffer with PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia. But my biggest struggle is my PTSD. When I was 17 i was stabbed in my neck, while i was asleep, by my brother. I remember everything so vividly. But i don't really want to get into all that right now.",1
"And in the 10 years since my emancipation, I've only watched my cognitive state decline. I've been agoraphobic for 3 years now. 3 years ago I moved into the shelter system after a domestic dispute triggered my agoraphobia again. I felt like I was under constant threat, and that I wasn't safe anymore. So I moved.",1
"I have been either an emt or a paramedic for the past 9 years. I have been a part of way more than I wanted to be, I cant help but see all the god damned faces. I cannot work because I tried to protect my girlfriend and property from a threat, ended up being someone shooting off fireworks...  i have been shot at enough and held it in. I just cant. im tired,  I want to give up.",1
"Having expected that, I told myself at the time that it doesn't bother me much and I'll go back to handling it all by myself as I've been doing for years, but it's been nagging at me for most of the day now. I keep doubting whether I really am wallowing in it. My trauma occured five years ago, and it doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as it used to (thanks to some tricks I learned on here and through my own research), and I believe I've been handling it all okay. I do my level best not to dwell on it, I've accepted it's in the past and will never happen again...except that doesn't stop the flashbacks and nightmares. I wasn't directly involved in my traumatic events, I only saw and heard them.",1
"I haven't ever been triggered by my grandma(until now) and even though it made me upset I had a ""well, it could be worse"" mentality. So yesterday my grandma got mad. Really mad. She started screaming at me, calling me names, and then threw a book at me. This triggered the trauma from my mom.",1

"Should I chill out and let her contact me?   ---   **tl;dr**: The level of communication outside of face-to-face interaction is making it difficult to maintain attraction and to set up plans with the woman I am dating, and it has become worse the last couple weeks despite our in-person interactions being consistently great. Am I being too anxious/not understanding enough or is she a bad communicator? How do I bring this up with her?",1
I'm trying to fill out the Claim of Exemption that came with the Notice of Levy packet that arrived yesterday. I'm extremely uncomfortable with this as so much is on the line. Google is useless. The best I've found are instructions stating to fill out the documents (duh!). Can anyone walk me through this?,1
"I got as far as Illinois when he ghosted me after urging me to leave in the first place. I've been going between three different friends who know I'm homeless but think I'm 19. I want to go to school, get a job to buy my own stuff, and get on with my life. I don't think my mom is looking for me, but I still need her signature to go to school. I don't want my new friends to get arrested for harboring a runaway youth as well.",1
"Are you fucking kidding me? YOU are not comfortable writing something to help me? YOU'RE uncomfortable writing a note and helping someone with a mental illness? Someone who has been trying everything fucking possible to live a normal life, someone who is seeking as much support as possible and only went to the idea of financial support as an absolute last resort? WHAT.",1
"But what do I know? I keep reassuring myself that this is normal, and never tell anyone about this - I'm surprising one of the top students at a selective high school, but I really want this to end. I'm good at hiding things like this, because I don't want others feeling pity for me for things they didn't cause or can change.   ---   **tl;dr**: Older brother psychologically and physically abuses me and my younger brother.",1
TW: physical abuse? My dad was screaming at me today and I started crying out of fear. Of course in my household crying is not allowed. Hence he physically hit me and tried to cover my mouth which led to me hitting him back out of defense. My gums ended up bleeding and I don't think anyone else was concerned about how I was feeling â€” they thought I was just overreacting and stuff.,1
But part of me fears that coming back out there I'll find a suicide. He's talked about it a lot and has plenty of guns. I had to take his Kimber .45 Raptor and Kimber .380 yesterday so I didn't have to worry about him shooting the dog. But they were just left o the counter cause I'm no thief. I just... Don't know what to do y'all....,1

"The messages are essentially the guy being flirtatious and asking her to come over to his place. My gfâ€™s responses are not flirtatious but definitely welcoming. She responded to his offer by saying â€œhow about we meet halfway and grab some lunch together some timeâ€. She never told me that she was even still in contact with this guy. And their relationship was explicitly sexual, not friendly.",1
"He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me. When I fell he stomped on my face and also choked me. I was trying to hit back but he's much bigger than me. When he starting choking me, I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off. He surprisingly did, after yelling about how it hurt, then went to finish packing.",1

In really shitty medical condition...and now I am going to be cut off from getting messages from any of my doctors, surgeon, or infusion clinic.",1
"I feel like I have the worst luck with everything, but maybe that's just bias. I feel like life has dealt me a short hand and I feel so guilty saying this because there are people out there with lives far worse than mine. Walking is painful, talking is painful, I don't know what to do. I just want everything to end. I just want to rest and not have to struggle.",1
"I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas. This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair. From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town. Apparently, they were all â€˜badâ€™ children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected.",1

"(He knows where we live and go to school) My moms in a ton of debt because of my dad. Right now both of them have a job but if my dad is no longer working, it's gonna be a lot harder to pay it off. I also go to a private school which costs a lot. How do we deal with this?",1
Not sure why but Iâ€™m really off today. I canâ€™t stop feeling like a screw up even though Iâ€™ve really done nothing wrong today. I feel like it might have been triggered by seeing an old family friend who asked how my abuser was or because I am having an injury flare up after doing really well. I just feel useless and unlovable. I have convinced myself even my husband doesnâ€™t like me.,1
"It wasn't a trap (like, wth?) and I just couldn't hide my emotions effectively. I know he has a lot on his mind lately and he's very anxious, but so do I, and I also feel it's unfair to him to use me as his emotional punching bag. I love the guy, but lately I've been thinking almost on daily basis whether to put an end to the relationship. I'm exhausted by his continuous lashing out and bullshit.",1
"I have several issues with anxiety, but urban driving is one of the worst. So of course, my wife drags me along to new york city and expects me to do the driving. Currently emotionally and physically exhausted. One of the worst things, one that i will cause me lose sleep at night is: im anxious because im unsure if paid a toll while traveling in a tunnel from JFK to jersey city.

"Weâ€™ve been together for two and half years but went through a rough patch not too long ago because I shipped off to basic. But now that Iâ€™m back we were good but now her depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies are pushing me away.

I am a stay at home mother of 3. My oldest is my husband's as his mum gsve up on him 5 years ago. My youngest was born with a congenital condition and my middle has ASD.

"Iâ€™ve been trying not to get triggered or stamping on the instincts to just leave the place and be silent. Even with that, I couldnâ€™t even really keep a hold and have had hard days where I just wanted to stay isolated from the world and disappear in my mind and try to heal myself and it isnâ€™t working. I struggle to sleep sometimes and I do struggle with self worth, being comfortable with myself because I just donâ€™t see myself as someone whoâ€™s important to other ppl. I'm really unsure how to deal with it. Also, I'm not sure if I should tell anyone because that couldn't have happened right and it could not have been that bad?",1

I mainly want to know if this would be considered rape: MOST RECENT ABUSE: I worked 7 days in a row and finally had one night off on a Friday. I expressed I wanted to spend it with him, but since I went out the night before he was determined to go out with his friends that night. I guess that also comes with ignoring me all night.",1
"I don't trust anyone, especially myself. I am going fucking crazy. I feel there's really only 3 conclusions to my life currently. The psych ward, which after being involuntarily admitted in January and paying close to $11K for that 4 day stint where no one gave a shit about me or even attempted to ask me more than 3 questions about my mental health a day, isn't an option. Plus I can't take off work indefinitely because I'm a basket sake.",1
"I feel like these experiences have totally altered my psyche and now i find gratification through exploitation. I even had the painful realization that ive never had any normal sexual relationship and these abuses are all i know. I broke down the other night just crying realizing that i dont get to be normal, and that i have sick urges. I heard that theres high rates of abused people become abusers too, and i hate that im part of the issue. Tl;Dr: I was abused and now i abuse, what can i do to cope?",1
The thoughts that have been pouring into my head theses past few days are terrifying. I wonder what driving my car off the side of the freeway would feel like. The relief that would come at the end. I feel so hopeless & I don't want to feel this way anymore. I wish I had a gaping wound so I could go into the hospital and they could fix me.,1
"Has anyone else had this sensation? Also, if I close my mouth so my teeth are close together, I can tell that they are constantly chattering. I've definitely been much more anxious than usual lately as I work full-time at an emotionally challenging job and just decided to go back to school to pursue a Master's degree via night classes, but this shaky sensation has been a little alarming as I can't tell if it is anxiety related or something worse (which certainly contributes to the anxiety!!). If anyone has any suggestions or words of wisdom, I would be so appreciative. Thanks in advance!",1

"I'd wake up in the middle of the night to him feeling my ass and masturbating. I was scared, and didn't know what to do so I just pretended not to notice. I can't even remember how long this must have went on, but soon enough I had decided to put my pillow on the other side of the mattress, because he'd touch me when I sleep on my side. I thought putting my pillow on the other side of the bed will help because as I fall asleep and turn on my left side my back will be towards the wall, and he won't be able to reach. I even remember him asking me the next day why I'd decided to move my pillow to the other side of the mattress.",1
"I was in my front yard talking to him on the phone, when I refused to hang-up she had a temper tantrum and screamed loudly enough for the people outside to hear her say I ""got online and talked to little boys."" Her father refuses to do anything about her or the other daughter or treats me just as bad. I try to stand up for myself, I mean I am their uncle after all, but they just yell, scream and call me names anyway.

As weâ€™re eating into our savings, it looks like Iâ€™ll have to put my business on hold and go back to work.",1
"I even tried to settle this outside of their insurance so that their insurance rates wouldn't go up. I feel afraid every time it becomes nighttime and when I have to go to school, because I know there is a chance I may see him again. I don't know how to stop thinking about what happened that night, what I could have done differently, or what would have happened if someone had come to save me. It's hard to tell my family I've begun to think about killing myself again. I've struggled with depression for years and this incident has only made it so much worse.",1
"Not being able to let go of the fact that I let this go on for so long, and even the fact that in my heart I still care and want him. In my mind I think ""if only"" or ""what if"" but I know those are facades. I know he will never be real, open or honest about who he is or what he did. I have to forgive myself for letting this take over my life, my heart, my emotions. I have to forgive myself for not listening to my gut and my intuition.",1
Good day. I am from the Philippines and I was recently diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety almost a month ago (July 10th). Since then it has been a very challenging and difficult time for me and my family. Work required me to secure a fit to work order before I can get back to work. My medical insurance does not cover mental health conditions and it took me over 3 weeks to secure one.,1
"Our justice system is not aimed at helping victims. I feel totally violated, put down, and blamed for requesting an extension on an order of protection.

"I get it; my one friend has personal reasons for being against medication, the other one has a bad personal experience, and my boyfriend had a small midwestern town upbringing that allowed no room for mental weakness so he has a hard time understanding. I guess I just...I donâ€™t know. I felt empowered to do this going into the appointment and even during it. I felt like people were on board with me seeking treatment if thatâ€™s what I felt was right. And now that itâ€™s a reality..it just seems like people have turned their backs and no longer are okay with it.",1
"They taunt me and remind me of my weakness. They remind me of my failures, and they are loud. Louder than anything. And there's so many of them. Swirling and swirling and telling me what an awful fucking person I am.",1
"I can't take much more. I hate being unworthy of the truth and feeling like I'm crazy for thinking this. This feels like my entire life, with everyone I've ever expected to love and care for me. I'm fucking over it. TL;DR I know my boyfriend is probably on drugs, or at least was actively using for some period of time recently, and you will probably agree with me if you read the evidence.",1
"(TW sexual abuse mentions) When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months, resulting in PTSD, and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked. I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in. I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing. I've never heard of anyone else doing this before though, is this normal?",1
"I can't even use the restroom because then I think about how if I were in the restroom when a shooter entered, the shooter could easily get me and the classrooms would be locked and I'd be locked out. I was late for one of my classes because I was afraid to leave my classroom. Does anyone else feel the same way? It's like I can't function normally anymore, school is such a scary place to be all of a sudden when it used to be a place I felt safe and comfortable, even though we had an open campus. Ugh.",1
"I'm now 18 Years old,from Germany and going to school right now, planning on study psyochologie. The only thing that seems to slow me down right now is chronic panicattack-like illness that seems to destroy everything I've build up for myself. It is a constant strain of thought that I fear the most that developed from the time I was six. Eversince I was six years old I started having weird forced habits like touching certian things for x amount of times or making weird noises. The older I got, the less I had these forced habits and the more I had something like a second ""voice"" in my head that was thinking of something entirely else and actually disturbing that I couldn't control.",1
"But Iâ€™m pissed, I waited to long for this like I honestly could have killed myself before they got back to me. I know thereâ€™s a lot of people in the system and their funding is low, but this is bullshit! The government doesnâ€™t give a shit about mentally ill people. If they did then there honestly would be way less crime rates and suicide rate because people would be getting the help that they need instead of waiting for some bad shit to happen before they get help. The urgency is just NOT there at all.",1
"He certainly had/has the ability to. The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely.

He is in bad shape and initially he lost the use of his legs few years ago and now his paralysis is rising up to his waste. So am I headed of to the hospital and stayed up north for the weekend.

"I changed jobs last year and moved up into a management role. I run a small program for kids and have 3 staff. Shortly after accepting my position, my job duties completely changed, I hired one new staff person, 2 staff quit and I hired 2 more, and it was up for debate on whether the program would cease to exist by 2019. It feels like Iâ€™ve been in survival mode, and everyone was abandoning me...even though I know it wasnâ€™t me they were abandoning. This was rough for me.",1
"She wants to live off these 400.00 and cut back on everything there is, even her own only connection back to her family if needed. My plan was, to get back to our parents for a while, until we both earn a bit better or find a cheaper place. But unfortunately, for her this is no option. She is afraid she can't go home, as she already once switched jobs and is afraid her mother won't accept her at home again. She blocks every attempt of mine to bring up the possibility of going back.",1
"She's been doing exams as of late and we've both had some personal problems so we haven't had time to work on our relationship. We both said we would stay together but sort it all out after she came back from a holiday she was going on with her uni. On the second last night she tells me she has kissed another guy and feels horrific about it. I tell her i'm going to leave because she has cheated in hope she realizes what life is like without me (stupid I know). I've always put her needs before mine, i've tried to give her everything and be the perfect boyfriend and because my natural defense mechanism is to retreat into my shell and shut the world out I don't reply to her texts that day.",1
"Ok here we go.... My original trauma was being molested by my grandfather starting around 7-8 (my best guess, only have a few memories, couldâ€™ve been earlier). I have very few memories of this, although I have gotten some back recently. I donâ€™t know how long it continues for but he died when I was 10/12 or so Around this time I was also severely bullied in school, my cousin being the ring leader.",1
"What do I do?   ---   **tl;dr**: My fiance completely cuts himself off from our son and me and sulks for days if his sports teams lose.

I really don't know what to do, I moved down south to be with her and so I have no friends or family here. She suffers from  agoraphobia so we never leave the house. Its also her place so Im scarred she is going to kick me out, she has used that against me in the past, it makes me feel very vunrable and scared.",1
"And he said that he had some deep feelings for me. So I suggested meeting at another time without booze. In the morning I had a text from him apologising for being an asshole. I replied and said I didn't think that, but that I was a little overwhelmed. Since then I have not heard much from him, but I can't stop thinking about it.",1
"He tells everyone weâ€™re his life. My family victim blames and theyâ€™re are ok with a multi millionaire pedophile in the family. So theyâ€™re disgusting and no help.

I have an amazing group of friends filled with the most genuine people you'd ever meet. And I'm a college graduate. I have this deep fear that he'll be right. I'm terrified that I only think I've broken the cycle but I haven't really. Thanks to PTSD I'll probably still have those moments.,1
"He explained that he didnâ€™t think it was such a big deal that he disclosed such personal information about me without my permission to his friends then he tried to flip it and said it was no different then a time I canceled plans with a friend and told them the reason was because he, Tom was sick with the flu and I was going to stay in and take care of him. How is me honestly explaining that the reason I would have to cancel on a friend because my boyfriend is sick, the same as him giving away very detailed information about our sex life plus other very personal traumas that I experienced without my permission? I feel like heâ€™s trying to gaslight me and Iâ€™m seeing a side to him Iâ€™ve never seen. Iâ€™m honestly thinking about ending things with him over this. TL;DR my boyfriend told his friends VERY detailed information about our sex life plus other personal things about my life without my permission and I feel so betrayed but heâ€™s trying to act like itâ€™s no big deal.",1
"I just want to get rid of the pent up confused bouncing energy inside me, so I cry because I've overwhelmed myself... not because I'm weak... That's what I tell myself at least.... I force myself to do things even if they make me uncomfortable just because I know normal ppl would not have the same issue.... Must act normal.. They won't like me if I don't... I am tired all the time, I just want someone to guide me. Take my hand and just understand I need their company to stop the war in my head, but torn because they say I should be able to do that for myself..",1
"As she was leaving she told me ""now I have to go back there again"" as she was sobbing. I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help. Everyone I've talked with as told me I should've gotten her phone number because looking her phone number up through our receipts and membership files is an invasion of privacy. Did I miss my only opportunity to help her by not asking for her phone number? Sorry for the sad story, I just don't know what to do and it's painful to think what is happening to her right now.",1
"I started a new job last Tuesday, and I have had some pretty severe anxiety most days, especially my first day. (As probably to be expected) This is my second job, and unlike my first one I have ZERO customer interaction so my social anxiety hasn't been nearly as bad as it was with my previous job. Now tomorrow morning I start my second week, and I was feeling fine all day today, but it's time to sleep and I can't even lay down without freaking out. I'd hate to call in sick after only one week but I don't know if I can make it like this. I'm freaking out and it's stopping me from getting any sleep.",1
I just feel kinda gross because I was giving her fucking college advice and stuff. I'm fucking furious. My clearest memory of my dad in highschool is him ramming my head repeatedly into a wall because I didn't want to pick engineering as a *second choice*. And NOW he chooses to support and help this fucking girl through college when I had to do all that on my own? He even skipped out on my graduation!,1
Hello I am having a massive anxiety attack over feeling nauseated. I hate the stomach flu it's a phobia of mine. Even meds don't take my anxiety away completely and they don't even help a lot honestly celexa is just the only medication where I don't get side effects and sometimes not even my clognezapan kicks in when I'm having panic attacks. I am at work and I cannot focus at all. I'm so scared I hate nausea I hate it.,1
"I also have pretty bad dissociative episodes which I've had since I was about 5. Anyway, a month ago I was prescribed prazocin to take before bed and I'm just on 1mg since I just started it.

"How could I when I felt so unwelcome? Idk, I'm sorry, I'm just so sick of carrying on when it's so fucking exhausting just to be told that it's never bloody fucking good enough for anyone.

I just want to drink a bottle of bleach and be fucking done with it.",1
"i quickly think to check them all out in seperate windows, and i confirm again that all of the profiles had been made very recently within the past month even up to the day of adding me. it's becoming really annoying having these profiles add me, and it's just weird that they're obviousy fake but why so specifically pose as a certain kind of person and add another? stuff about me: im a lesbian so don't date older men, and i've never really hung out with anyone older than 40 so i know i can't actually know these people. and if its some weird joke; i have no daddy issues, my dad is still around and its not really a funny joke its just weird.  i also note that one of the profiles, which has since disappeared, was really REALLY creepy.",1
This kind of thing just makes me want to stop. Why do people go out of their way to be negative to someone asking a question and trying to get help? It stresses me out.. Anyone else have this issue or get anxious over this? Or am I just being silly?,1
"Years ago on this day, you did things to me I will not say. Although I might have lost a fight, nothing about that at all was right.

I wrote this all straight from my heart, take responsibility for your part.""",1

I'm torn between wanting to be alone, wanting to reach out for help, talking to people just so I can yell and push them away. I don't know what to do. That's a lie, I think I do but I don't want to. Any effort is exhausting and I can't bring myself to fix it.",1
"I feel like a complete and utter fuck up. And it just fucking hurts. Iâ€™m filled with what ifâ€™s. â€œWhat if you didnâ€™t ever use pot and was that what made you feel physically ill?â€ â€œWhat if it wasnâ€™t that, but just high anxiety?â€ â€œWhat if I pushed through and got the job and things turned out well? How happy would you be compared to where you are now?â€ (I should mention I am not at a great place in my life right now in many ways, including employment).",1
So he leaned in and kissed me with tongue. I was embarrassed because that was my first kiss. Then the next time I saw him he stuck his fingers in me even though I said no and unzipped his pants. I kicked him off of me and rode my bike all the way home with blood running down my legs. I didn't tell my dad because I was afraid he would beat me.,1

Itâ€™s only a matter of time.",1
"He's been violent pretty much since 6months in. Nothing too horrendous at first just a slap or a punch or he'd spit in my face during an argument or grab me. I reasoned I could deal with that because he was always so remorseful and depressed afterwards. A year in we split up because he stole my car keys out of the ignition, got in the car and threatened to kill me rip out my hair and nails etc. I went to the police and they issued him with a domestic violence order.",1

I need to see a therapist but I don't know what to do. I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place. I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart. It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.",1

This week has been bad. I'm crying over everything. I'm struggling at work to get basic tasks done. I am SO HEAVILY OVERWHELMED by the smallest things. My sink was so full of dishes to the point where I had no clean ones left and because the pile was so high I couldn't go near it and just cried.,1
"The few days following this I was a wreck, an absolute mess. Crying at work, shaking, anxious, sweating, and couldn't eat. Through the week I wound up losing nearly 6lbs and have been everything from manic depressed to furious, to scared out of my wits to utterly confused aaand all the way back around again. The other night I told him I needed an answer. WHAT are we doing?",1
"I think itâ€™s possible that these feelings are coming from the fact that he has said he loves me while drunk but canâ€™t say it sober. I havenâ€™t brought his up to him, but it makes me feel like he canâ€™t say it because of his ex. Which I understand, but it also makes me sad that heâ€™s not excited to be in love with me. I think part of me also feels like a second choice, or like Iâ€™m being compared to her. Itâ€™s eapecially awful when I think about how ready I would have been to to go back to my ex when I was still heartbroken.",1
"I desperately miss my childhood and I wish I could have it back. After being molested, I feel that it was cut short. I'm afraid of getting older, and getting to the age where l have less time left than I've already lived. I think about it every day and it consumes me entirely. I'm obsessed with extending my lifespan on one end, and just killing myself on the other",1
"But I donâ€™t know why I get this feeling. What can I do to stop feeling this way? I want to focus on me and my things without having to think about her and what sheâ€™s doing all the time, so I can be less distracted and focused on my other priorities. TL;DR I want to focus on my priorities in life but I find myself getting wrapped up in my thoughts about what where, and what my girlfriend is doing.",1
"Part of me wonders if it's not my mom's fine-tuned manipulation at work, but it's sure as hell eating at me. How do I get out of his harmful headspace? It feels like my emotions and my logic are at war right now. Even after the abuse and trauma I've endured at the hands of my mom I still question the validity of my experience because I know there are people that have it a lot worse. And seeing that video was like watching a train wreck, it made me feel so awful because of its violent nature but it also made me doubt a lot of what I'm still experiencing.",1
"Everytime, he gets mad he takes my phone or other items away from me and tells me he bought it so it's his. He's even broke my iPhone which I bought a long time ago. He doesn't give me money and if I want some, I need a good reason why. He works overnights which makes things very hard for me, because the Long island railroad barely runs during those times and even then I have a 2months old, where would the baby and I go overnight? I don't know what to do, but I'm tired of feeling trapped and helpless.",1
"Itâ€™s subconscious for sure, but just a feeling I get. Iâ€™m terrified of him, and praying that he gets the real help he needs at the same time. And I just donâ€™t know how to sort that out. I donâ€™t know how to stop worrying and wondering what heâ€™s doing, we have several court dates coming up so I think that adds to it. Iâ€™m just so exhausted and ready for this fight to be over.",1
"But even after that he still says things that makes me feel uncomfortable. For example, when I suggest we do something or go somewhere that could be somewhat unique/interesting (e.g., watching a documentary about sex workers in their 60s, or going to a church in Vienna to listen to the choir boys sing), his first reaction via text is ""wtf?"" I instantly feel bad and angry because he is saying wtf to my plans and interests. When I confront him about it, he says he ""wasn't saying it to me."" His excuse is that he was saying wtf about [insert whatever the subject matter was].",1
"I instantly thought of something I rarely think about, being molested in a pool locker room when I was 10. My heart started beating incredibly fast as I readied myself to tell them the thing I couldnâ€™t even tell my family at the time. I started crying, something I havenâ€™t done in years and something my friends have never seen me do. When it got to me, with my hand over my eyes all I could say was â€œI donâ€™t think I canâ€. It felt like I was reliving what Iâ€™d gone through, like I could see it happening in front of me.",1
"I'm 26. Tuesday is day one of therapy. Day one of me trying to talk about whatever has been going on in my head for the last decade, last 2 decades. I'm terrified to talk but tired of living like this. Tired of the nocturnal panic attacks, tired of crying in the shower, tired of not feeling in control of my head, tired of the pointless thought circles that eat me up daily on something that doesn't matter.",1
"I was terrified and scared and couldn't get away. She just said he was ""joking around"" but it was horrible. I get a sting of panic and fear if anyone pinches me today. I can't even use a lighter without fear of it (Fire is fine, it's Just that kind of lighters). I also panic if anybody raises their voice or sounds angry.",1
"For example, she told me I was too stubborn. This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions, my social behaviors, and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her. She also constantly mocks me when we fight, literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth. She refuses to listen to my point of view. We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.",1
"The misery is so much worse than pre-lamictal, the torment is so much scarier. It feels almost demonic, like someone outside of me is tormenting me (I do not mean this literally or psychotically, it's just my subjective description). I have crying spells all day, I mean the entire day, doesn't matter who I'm hanging out with, doesn't matter if I'm at work (I had to quit for the time being), doesn't matter if I'm working out. I shake and cry and shake and cry, like wailing violent cries. It's terrifying, it feels very ""chemical"" and out of control, like the absence of the drug does this to me, and it's scary for the people around me.",1
I was able to get my old office job back and that comes with okay pay and good benefits I start November 1st . Just trying to take steps to make sure weâ€™re okay before we get too behind and stuck on the streets . Anything is appreciated all I have 11$ to my name until Friday . Pm me you would like to help  . I am starting a gofund me sometime this week to help us if anyone is interested in that I will keep you updated,1
"It sent me into a full-blown crisis by breaking open the â€œno one believes me and Iâ€™m worthlessâ€ wound. I had to up my level of care, now Iâ€™m in IOP 5 days a week, 3+ hours a day. Itâ€™s given me just enough relief to return to weekly EMDR. I had my first session in this round, last week. It was the most physically symptomatic Iâ€™ve ever been in-session.",1
"He doesn't have to spend a load of money on things I like! He can use it to spend on himself. I don't understand why he feels that just because we're in a relationship that he has to ""spoil"" me. I enjoy being spoiled but only when I'm the one spoiling myself, haha. TL;Dr: My boyfriend doesn't like that I don't want him to do anything for me",1
"Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m the third wheel in their relationship. And this doesnâ€™t even include what they may do when Iâ€™m not around! Also, whenever roommate will talk about boys or finding a boyfriend, I notice husband will quickly try to shut that idea down fast, and say he knows roommate isnâ€™t attracted to said guy or doesnâ€™t want/need a boyfriend. Thereâ€™s definitely an emotional dependency there. I know my husband has explained to me over and over how much he helps her and how important he is in her life.",1
"Whenever I have a reaction or meltdown, he always tries to give shitty advice like ""just think about the things you're grateful for."" I'm sorry, but in the therapies I've taken and in the books I have to help me, nothing *anywhere* says anything about gratitude and it tends to trigger me when he says this because it's what my narcy mom would say to me. I tried to explain this and asked him to read my books and he got mad at me because in his mind I was trying to tell him what to do and I was being ""ungrateful"" for his help. I told him how important it was to me for him to read these books because it would help me feel more understood, but he keeps coming up with excuse after excuse about why he doesn't want to read them. I just don't know what to do anymore.",1
"While sitting on my normally-quiet front porch today, one of my unbelievably extroverted neighbors was carrying on the loudest conversation I've ever heard on a quiet street. Her conversation partners used a normal volume - she was the only one yelling words at the top of her lungs. I wanted to snap her clueless little head off. Or at the very least, tell her to shut the f$*( up. Grumpy?",1
"My friends and family don't understand why he is so jealous and controlling because they know when I'm in a relationship I'm faithful. Im ready to take him out of my life, but what should I do? When hes angry I don't know what extent he would go to. How should I handle it? Ignore him or communicate calmly so he doesn't get mad?",1
"Maybe kind of nauseous? Not in a normal nauseated feeling. Its more like that pit of my stomach, I'm about to get in big trouble, or I'm waiting for the cops to come pick me up or something haha. Like, it has that prickle in my spine to it. And that restlessness in my head.",1
"I am just sick of this being my daily life. Between the derealization and the hypervigilance and paranoia even on good days I still don't feel like a person - and that's not even touching the flashbacks and nightmares. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't find a shrink who I trust or who seems equipped to help with the particular symptoms I have, and that seems like my only option. What do I do?",1
"I was in a rabbit hole of youtube videos over the weekend, starting off from music videos, then vine compilations, and then somehow fight videos. On one of the side videos, I noticed a video involving ""XYZ high school"" where my boyfriend attended. The video was actually pretty clear and my blood kind of ran cold when I realized one of the 2 kids in the video was my boyfriend. It was absolutely brutal. And there's no doubt that this was him.",1
We went home the next day. And now i fcking dont know what to do. My heart rate feels like itâ€™s shaking the whole bed. Im dying. TLDR i got friendzoned at the beach and I cant take it like a man,1
"For those that have sought help before, is it as bad as I am imagining? Will I be taken seriously? I feel that because I put myself in that situation, I sort of don't deserve help if that makes sense. I'm not even sure this is the right place to post as I'm not sure it's even a possibility to get some sort of ptsd from something like this. Sorry for the rambling, and thank you for reading.",1
"He apologizes if I point it out later, but the first instinct is always to blame me. And often the thing he's blaming me for is exaggerated, and made to look like a routine flaw in me, even if it's a once off thing. He doesn't hesitate to show his bad mood/displeasure (which applies to how he is around most people not just me, but I think it's worse when it's about me). He doesn't hide it at all even if we're around other people, so I have to be particularly cautious not to piss him off or bring up anything that could upset him in public. When he's upset/displeased in private, he withdraws and it's up to me to grovel and convince him to talk to me again.",1
"After talking with my psych she made me realize that anxiety has been the route of my negative feelings and it was likely anxiety causing depression. Despite this, however, she never seemed to understand just how severe my symptoms were. I would try to stay calm and describe how i felt to the best of my ability, however it wasn't until she saw me have an anxiety attack over asking her a \_very\_ simple question that she finally understood the severity. She said I seemed to downplay how I felt, so I took this into account for future reference. Eventually I move on to starting antidepressants, citalopram to start off.",1
"I couldn't speak but finally managed to say, ""Bag, get my bag."" He was able to help me with my pills and touch me and talk to me enough that I came back. Now boyfriend is back to bed, and I'm assuming I'll be up for the rest of the night. I don't know what to do with this. This is scary stuff.",1
"I am quite introverted and the broken friendship I had with my previous roommate made me feel very anxious, so I moved into an apartment on my own. I love living alone, but when I have severe anxiety attacks it becomes lonely and almost unbearable. I sometimes think so much that it feels like I am going crazy. I have terrifying thoughts and I make up scenarios in which I have some terrible condition, or I am dying. My parents know that I have anxiety, but never took it too seriously.",1
"She has not once shown disappointment. When she sees me get frustrated, she lays next to me and holds me. Asks me what I need to relax. But it's becoming a self perpetuating cycle and I'm getting panicky that this is going to drive a wedge between us because she will start to feel that she doesn't excite me or satisfy me or whatever. Before anyone asks, the pipes all work.",1
"This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)! This is the same anxiety that has stopped me before, and I am NOT letting it stop me again. To anybody who's experienced this before, what tips or strategies can you give me to help overcome it? TL;DR- Very anxious about upcoming trip because I'm afraid of being trapped/away from the comfort of my home, to the point where it's affecting other parts of my life, how do I get over the anticipatory anxiety so I can enjoy myself?",1
"I might be homeless soon, I have about 500 dollars in my bank account and I NEED to get out of Massachusetts. I am going to be a college drop-out in my 3rd year due to family reason instead of academics. After a lot of research, I am contemplating between Wichita, Kansas and Columbus, Ohio. I really just want a minimum wage job so I can have a bed and private bathroom. Afterward I can get my life together and start taking programming jobs again.",1
"**I don't want to be anxious in drawing class. ** It's supposed to be my escape, my one place where I can do what I want and be who I choose. Instead it's turning out to be a trigger for anxiety. I refuse to drop my drawing class- I've already committed to trying to be an artist. What kind of artist doesn't take drawing in high school?!",1
"All of this has made me feel really horrible. It has destroyed my self esteem and made me feel depressed, unlovable, worthless, responsible, etc. It has also had severe and debilitating impacts on my mental and physical health.",1
"Even when she hated me, I didn't hate her. There weren't enough good friends in my life for me to afford hating her, and there still aren't. I can't describe it. She and my mom were chatting at dinner (they're the talkers of the family), and the whole time, I was just glaring at her. She tried talking to me, and I felt my entire body physically tense, and I was just viscerally angry.",1
"Accounts incredibly overdue. A life entirely unattended to, without organization or care. Chaos. I knew none of this. The man he presented to me was one of principle (honesty, loyalty, your word is your bond, etc), always ready to protect and serve in whatever way necessary.",1
"Hey, So I come from a middle class family and study far away from my parents for university (already scary for me as you can imagine). After going home this winter my parents dropped the bombshell on me that they are struggling to pay my tuition. The thing is, although we are not super rich or anything, my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing, the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up. My tuition is due this friday and I just called my parents and woke them up to inform them that its getting really serious now (my dad promised to make an arrangement with his friend to pay my tuition).",1
"But then I'll get there and he'll drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and to be honest, it totally makes me want to bail early. It's just annoying to be invited to come over and thinking you're gonna have some bro time gaming and what not, only to get there have him drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and being stuck between either listening to 5th grade cheesy/cringeworthy convos or figuring a way to bail early without coming across as an asshole. How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter, that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not! Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that. Thanks in advance!",1
"I don't have the ability to cope with it anymore. I'm trying, but a lot of things are triggering me, and I'm shutting down at work, just finding the place I feel safest, and staying there for an hour or two until I feel like I can do something again. I'm tired of watching my back, tired of traveling to places I don't feel safe, tired of reliving that moment, tired of being triggered, tired of the stress, tired of anxiety and knots in my stomach, tired of irrational thought when triggered, tired of irrational paranoia. I'm exhausted and need a break, but know it won't be enough until I journey the long road through therapy. I'm not suicidal at all, just wishing this pain and misery would end, to have my life back again.",1
"I was talking to my mom this morning and she said that about my sister. Her trauma was worse than mine but she didn't develop PTSD. (My mom has no idea I even had a traumatic event) I told her it's not that easy, and she said it just needs to be done. Now I am scared.",1
